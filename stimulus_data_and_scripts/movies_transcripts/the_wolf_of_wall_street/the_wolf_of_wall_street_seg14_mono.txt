27.4: You
27.6: know,

29.2: five
29.7: years
29.9: ago,
30.0: when
30.3: I
30.4: started
30.7: Stratton
31.5: Oakmont

32.0: with
32.2: Donnie
32.4: Azoff,
32.6: I
32.8: knew
33.0: the
33.2: day

34.2: would
34.7: eventually
35.0: come
35.4: where
35.6: I
35.6: would
35.7: have
35.8: to
36.0: be
36.1: moving
36.4: on.

39.5: And
39.5: it
39.6: is
40.1: truly
40.3: with
40.6: a
40.6: heavy
40.9: heart

41.1: that
41.3: I
41.5: am
41.7: here
41.9: to
42.1: say
42.3: that...

44.8: That
45.2: that
45.6: day
46.0: is
46.1: finally
46.4: here.

51.3: I
51.5: wanna...
51.7: I
51.9: want
52.1: to
52.3: thank
52.5: you
52.7: all
52.9: for
53.1: your...

53.6: Your
53.8: years
54.0: of
54.2: loyalty
54.4: and
54.6: admiration.

56.2: But
56.8: the
57.0: point
57.4: is
57.6: this.

58.8: Under
59.3: Donnie's
59.4: leadership,

60.3: along
60.5: with
60.8: Nicky
61.3: Koskoff
61.6: and
62.4: Robbie
62.7: Feinberg

63.7: moving
64.0: into
64.4: key
64.5: management
65.0: positions,
65.5: this
65.7: place
66.0: really

66.4: is
66.8: gonna
67.3: be
67.4: better
67.6: than
67.8: ever!

68.0: That
68.2: I
68.4: promise
68.6: you.
68.8: Okay?

70.5: Give
70.7: them
70.9: a
71.1: round
71.3: of
71.5: applause.
71.7: Come
71.9: on.

76.4: This
76.9: is
77.1: Ellis
77.5: Island
77.6: here,
77.7: people.

79.0: I
79.2: do
79.4: not
79.6: care
79.8: who
80.0: you
80.2: are,
80.4: where
80.6: you
80.8: are
81.0: from,

80.7: whether
81.0: your
81.1: relatives
81.4: came
81.8: over
82.1: on
82.2: the
82.2: fucking
82.7: Mayflower

83.3: or
83.5: on
83.7: an
83.9: inner
84.1: tube
84.3: from
84.5: Haiti,

85.7: this
86.3: right
86.6: here
86.8: is
86.9: the
87.0: land
87.4: of
87.4: opportunity.

88.3: Stratton
88.7: Oakmont
89.0: is
89.9: America!

94.4: All
94.9: of
95.0: you
95.1: know
95.3: Kimmie
95.7: Belzer,
96.0: right?

96.0: Yes,
96.7: we
96.9: do.

97.7: Fuck
98.1: you.

98.7: Come
99.1: on,
99.3: Kimmie.

100.6: What
100.8: you
100.9: probably
101.1: did
101.1: not
101.5: know
101.6: is,

102.0: Kimmie
102.5: was
102.7: one
102.9: of
103.0: the
103.0: first
103.3: brokers
103.5: here,

104.3: one
104.5: of
104.7: Stratton's
105.0: original
105.5: 20.

107.1: Now
107.5: most
107.6: of
107.8: you
107.9: met
108.1: Kimmie,

109.0: the
109.2: beautiful
109.4: sophisticated
109.6: woman
109.8: that
110.0: she
110.2: is
110.4: today.

112.4: A
112.4: woman
113.1: that
113.3: wears
113.5: $3,000
114.3: Armani
115.2: suits.

117.5: Who
117.7: drives
117.9: a
118.1: brand-new
118.3: Mercedes-Benz.

120.7: A
120.7: woman
121.3: who
121.5: spends

122.7: her
122.8: winters
123.6: in
123.7: the
123.8: Bahamas

124.2: and
124.5: summers
125.0: in
125.1: the
125.1: Hamptons!

131.3: That
131.5: is
131.7: not
131.9: the
132.0: Kimmie
132.2: that
132.4: I
132.6: met.

136.5: The
136.7: Kimmie
137.3: that
137.5: I
137.7: met
137.9: did
137.9: not
138.1: have
138.2: two
138.5: nickels
138.5: to
139.0: rub
139.1: together.

141.5: She
141.7: was
141.9: a
142.1: single
142.3: mom
142.5: on
142.7: the
142.9: balls
143.1: of
143.3: her
143.5: ass

144.0: with
144.1: an
144.3: 8-year-old
144.7: son.

145.8: Okay?
146.4: She
146.6: was
146.7: three
147.0: months
147.1: behind
147.5: on
147.8: her
148.0: rent.

149.8: And
150.3: when
150.4: she
150.5: came
150.8: to
150.9: me
151.1: and
151.3: asked
151.5: me
151.7: for
151.9: a
152.1: job,

153.6: she
154.0: asked
154.3: for
154.3: a
154.4: $5,000
155.6: advance

156.1: just
157.1: so
157.2: she
157.3: could
157.6: pay
157.8: her
157.9: son's
158.3: tuition.

163.5: And
163.6: what
163.8: would
164.0: I
164.2: do,
164.4: Kimmie?

165.3: Go
165.5: on,
165.7: tell
165.9: them.

168.9: You
169.2: wrote
169.6: me
169.7: a
169.9: check

171.1: for
171.5: $25,000.

174.4: That
174.6: is
174.8: right.

176.0: Thank
176.2: you.

180.7: And
180.8: you
181.0: know
181.2: why
181.4: that
181.5: is?

185.8: It
185.9: is
186.1: because
186.3: I
186.5: believed
186.7: in
186.9: you.

189.8: It
189.9: is
190.0: because
190.5: I
190.7: believed
191.0: in
191.2: you,
191.4: Kimmie,

193.2: just
193.6: like
193.9: I
194.0: believe
194.3: in
194.5: each

194.8: and
195.0: every
195.2: one
195.4: of
195.6: you
195.8: here
196.0: today.

196.9: I

197.6: love
198.0: you,
198.4: Jordan!
198.6: I
198.8: fucking

202.3: I
202.5: fucking

202.9: you,
203.1: too!

207.0: And
207.1: I
207.3: love
207.5: all
207.7: of
207.9: you!

209.6: And
209.8: I
210.0: love
210.2: all
210.4: of
210.6: you
210.8: from
211.0: the
211.2: bottom
211.4: of
211.6: my
211.8: heart.

212.0: I
212.2: fucking
212.4: love
212.6: you,
212.8: too.
213.0: I
213.2: mean

215.9: shit.
216.1: You

224.1: It
224.3: is
224.5: a
224.7: shame,
224.9: you
225.1: know.

227.9: For
228.3: years,
228.6: I
228.6: have
228.7: been
228.8: telling
229.3: you
229.4: guys

229.8: never

232.8: to
233.2: keep
233.4: pushing,
233.7: to
234.1: never

390.4: Paddy
390.7: D,

412.9: our
413.2: time
413.5: to

420.6: him

420.6: for
420.8: his

423.2: said
423.4: no,
423.6: that
423.8: he
424.0: was

425.3: not
425.6: want
425.8: any
425.9: part
426.1: of

428.7: two
429.0: years
429.3: later

430.2: he

441.6: not
441.7: know
441.9: why
441.9: that
442.0: came

446.5: subpoenas
447.6: started
