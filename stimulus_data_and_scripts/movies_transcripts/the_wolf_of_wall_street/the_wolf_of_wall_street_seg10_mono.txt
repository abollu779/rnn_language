1.2: But
1.3: I
1.5: want
1.7: you
1.8: to
1.9: understand,
2.5: we
2.7: do
2.7: not

4.0: do
4.5: anything
5.0: illegal.

6.4: Whatsoever.

7.5: I
7.7: mean,
8.0: you
8.1: could
8.2: talk
8.3: to
8.4: the
8.5: SEC.

9.2: They
9.3: were
9.5: at
9.7: my
9.9: office
10.3: 15
10.8: times
11.0: over
11.3: the
11.4: last
11.7: six
12.0: months.

12.2: I
12.4: mean,
12.6: I
12.8: got...
13.0: I
13.2: got
13.4: nothing
13.6: to
13.8: hide.

14.8: Well,
15.2: you
15.4: know
15.6: the
15.7: SEC
16.3: is
16.4: a
16.5: civil
16.8: regulatory
17.4: agency.

17.8: We
18.0: pursue
18.2: criminal
18.4: activities.

19.3: Exactly!
20.2: You
20.3: go
21.0: after
21.3: real
21.5: criminals,
22.1: which

23.0: makes
23.3: me
23.6: wonder
23.7: what
24.0: the
24.5: hell
24.7: you
24.9: are
25.1: investigating
25.3: me
25.5: for?

25.4: I
25.6: mean,
25.8: honestly...

28.1: What
28.1: is
28.2: it
28.4: that
28.6: you
28.8: think
28.9: that
29.1: we
29.7: did
30.0: or
30.3: do?
30.7: I
30.8: do
31.0: not
31.1: get
31.3: it.

31.4: Well,
31.6: I...

32.8: Look,
32.9: Jordan,
33.4: I
33.5: can
33.5: not
33.8: discuss
34.2: an
34.3: ongoing
34.4: investigation.

35.2: No,
35.6: I
36.0: get
36.3: that.
36.5: No,
36.7: I
36.9: understand.

37.1: With
37.3: that
37.5: said...

39.5: This
39.9: case
40.1: got
40.3: dumped
40.6: on
40.6: my
40.8: desk...

41.2: Did
41.4: it?
41.6: You
41.8: know,
42.0: by
42.2: a
42.4: higher-up

42.9: who
43.1: needs
43.3: to
43.5: make
43.7: a
43.9: show

44.2: of
44.3: looking
44.8: into
45.0: the
45.3: new
45.4: company
45.8: on
46.0: the
46.3: block,

46.4: with
46.6: all
46.8: the
47.0: press
47.2: and
47.4: everything.
47.6: New
47.8: loud
48.0: guys.

48.3: And
48.5: then
48.7: I
48.9: end
49.1: up
49.3: being
49.5: the
49.7: schmuck

49.8: who
49.8: does
49.8: the
49.8: looking.
49.8: Exactly.

51.6: It
51.8: is
52.1: just,
52.3: you
52.5: know...
52.7: It
52.9: bothers
53.1: me.

53.7: We
53.9: are
54.1: the
54.3: new
54.4: guy.
54.5: We
54.7: are
54.8: the
55.0: one

55.1: that
55.2: is
55.4: banging
55.8: on
55.9: Wall
56.1: Street's
56.3: door.
56.5: I
56.7: mean,
57.0: you
57.1: should...

57.6: You
58.0: should
58.2: see
58.2: what
58.3: is
58.5: going
58.8: on
58.9: at
59.0: the
59.2: bigger
59.4: firms.

59.4: I
59.7: mean,
59.8: I
60.0: know
60.2: all
60.4: the
60.5: information.

61.1: It
61.3: is
61.5: true!
61.7: Goldman,
61.9: Lehman
62.1: Brothers,
62.3: Merrill...

64.1: Collateralized
65.3: debt
65.3: obligations?

66.1: This
66.3: Internet
66.5: stock
66.7: bullshit?

67.4: I
67.5: mean,
67.6: it
67.8: is
67.9: a
68.1: fucking
68.5: travesty.

69.9: I
70.0: could
70.1: take
70.4: you
70.5: step-by-step

71.5: through
71.9: what
72.2: exactly
73.1: is
73.3: occurring.

74.6: All
74.8: you
75.1: have
75.2: to
75.3: do
75.4: is
75.5: ask.

76.4: I
76.4: am
76.8: available.

77.8: That
77.8: is
77.8: exactly
78.6: what
78.7: I
78.8: wanted
78.9: to
79.0: hear.
79.2: Mmm-hmm.

79.2: I
79.4: do
79.4: not
80.0: see
80.1: why
80.2: a
80.6: little
80.9: sitdown
81.2: like
81.5: this

83.1: can
83.3: not
83.5: be
83.6: profitable
84.1: for
84.1: the
84.2: both
84.4: of
84.6: us.

84.6: It
84.6: should.
84.6: Right?
84.7: It
84.7: should
84.8: profit
85.0: the
85.2: both
85.4: of
85.6: us.

86.9: It
87.3: should.
87.8: Look.

89.1: I
89.1: am
89.3: gonna
89.6: give
89.7: you
89.8: my
89.8: personal
90.2: line.

91.4: Five
91.9: days
92.2: a
92.3: week,
92.3: you
92.7: just
93.0: call
93.2: me,
93.2: feel
93.6: free.

94.5: I
94.5: will
94.9: do
95.0: that.
95.2: Great.

98.7: Are
98.9: you
99.2: sure
99.3: you
99.5: guys
99.6: do
99.6: not
99.8: want
99.9: something
100.2: to
100.3: drink?

100.9: You
100.9: are
101.1: not
101.2: hungry?
101.4: Nothing?

102.3: Nothing?
102.5: No?
102.7: Oh,
102.9: no.

107.0: Let
107.1: me
107.5: ask
107.8: you,

108.1: and
108.5: if
108.6: you
108.7: do
108.7: not
108.8: wanna
109.0: get
109.2: too
109.4: personal,

109.9: just
110.1: tell
110.3: me
110.4: to
110.5: shut
110.5: up
110.8: at
111.0: any
111.1: time.
111.3: Oh.

112.9: Did
113.3: you
113.3: try
113.5: to
113.6: get
113.8: your
113.8: broker's
114.1: license
114.4: at
114.8: one
115.0: time?

115.6: Did
115.7: I
115.9: hear
116.1: that
116.3: right?
116.4: Were
116.5: you
116.7: trying
117.0: to
117.0: take
117.5: a
117.5: stab
117.9: at
117.9: Wall
118.2: Street?

119.3: No?
119.5: Who
119.7: you
119.9: been
120.1: talking
120.3: to?

121.3: Who
121.7: the
121.9: fuck
122.1: you
122.3: been
122.5: talking
122.7: to?

122.4: Well,
122.6: you
122.8: are
123.0: investigating
123.2: me.

123.5: I
123.7: hear
123.9: things.

125.1: You
125.3: know
125.5: what
125.7: I
125.9: mean?

127.5: You
127.6: ever
128.1: think
128.2: about
128.3: what
128.6: would
128.8: have
128.9: happened

129.3: if
129.4: you
129.5: would
129.7: have
129.8: stayed
130.5: the
130.7: course?

133.0: You
133.3: know
133.4: what?
133.5: When
133.6: I
133.6: am
133.8: riding
134.2: home
134.3: on
134.4: the
134.6: subway

134.8: and
135.1: my
135.2: balls
135.5: are
135.6: fucking
135.8: sweating,

136.2: I
136.4: am
136.6: wearing
136.8: the
137.0: same
137.2: suit
137.4: three
137.6: days
137.8: in
138.0: a
138.2: row...

138.1: Yeah,
138.3: you
138.5: bet
138.7: I
138.9: do.

139.5: I
139.6: have
139.7: thought
140.4: about
140.5: it
140.7: before.
140.9: Who
141.1: would,
141.3: not
141.5: right?

141.4: Right,
141.6: who
141.8: fucking
142.0: would?
142.2: not

142.6: What
142.8: do
143.0: you
143.2: get...

143.6: Another
144.1: personal
144.5: question,
144.7: no
144.9: need
145.1: to
145.3: answer...

145.1: No,
145.3: that
145.5: is
145.7: all
145.9: right,
146.1: Jordan.

146.6: What
146.8: do
147.1: you
147.3: pull
147.6: in?
147.8: 50,
148.1: 60K?
148.3: Something
149.1: like
149.2: that?

149.8: A
149.9: year?
150.1: In
150.3: the
150.5: ballpark?
150.7: Oh.

151.8: Well,
152.0: I...

153.6: Let's
154.0: put
154.1: it
154.2: this
154.2: way.

155.3: You
155.8: get
156.0: a
156.1: free
156.3: handgun

156.6: when
156.8: you
157.0: sign
157.2: up
157.4: for
157.6: the
157.8: Bureau.

158.7: No,
159.0: but
159.2: it
159.6: fucking
159.8: pisses
160.2: me
160.3: off.
160.6: You
160.8: know
160.9: what
161.0: I
161.2: mean?

161.0: You
161.2: think
161.4: about
161.6: the
161.8: people
162.0: that
162.2: built
162.4: this
162.6: country,

163.3: hardworking
164.2: people
164.5: like
164.8: you.

165.3: Firefighters,
165.7: teachers,
166.5: FBI
166.7: agents.

167.5: End
168.0: of
168.0: the
168.1: day,
168.2: you
168.4: guys
168.6: get
168.9: fucking
169.5: skinned
170.0: alive
170.2: financially.

171.2: It
171.4: fucking
171.6: makes
171.8: me
172.0: angry.

173.2: Now
173.8: the
173.8: one
174.1: thing
174.3: about
174.5: Wall
174.9: Street
175.1: and
175.4: this
175.5: market
175.9: is,

176.3: for
176.8: me,
177.0: I
177.3: feel

179.0: it
179.2: is
179.5: good
179.6: to
179.7: give
179.9: back.
180.1: You
180.3: know,
180.5: there's...

181.5: There
181.5: are
181.6: situations
182.6: where
182.8: I
182.9: can

183.8: make
184.2: those
184.4: situations
184.6: better
186.0: for
186.2: people.
186.4: You
186.6: know?

187.4: You
187.6: know
187.8: what
188.0: I
188.2: mean.

188.9: Opportunity

190.7: is
190.9: everything.

191.9: Exactly.

193.2: Take
193.5: for
193.9: example,
194.2: I
194.2: got
194.4: this
194.5: one
194.8: kid,
195.1: right?

197.3: Went
197.5: to
197.5: school
197.9: for
198.1: environmental
198.4: science,
199.1: something
199.4: like
199.5: that.

199.8: He
199.9: was
199.9: bogged
200.4: down
200.5: by
200.6: student
200.8: loans.

201.5: Turns
202.0: out,
202.1: his
202.3: mother
202.6: needed
202.9: triple
203.2: bypass
203.4: surgery.

204.0: Jesus.
204.2: Right.
204.4: Horrible
204.6: situation.

205.7: Sure.

206.6: But
206.9: we
207.1: got
207.2: him
207.4: into
207.6: the
207.6: market

207.8: at
208.0: the
208.2: right
208.5: time
208.8: and
209.0: chose
209.2: the
209.4: right
209.6: stock.

209.7: We
209.9: gave
210.1: him
210.3: the
210.5: right
210.7: guidance.

211.7: Boom!
212.1: Overnight,
212.6: changed
213.1: his
213.7: entire
214.2: life.

215.0: Got
215.4: to
215.5: put
216.1: his
216.2: mother
216.4: into

216.6: the
216.7: best
217.1: hospital
217.5: in
217.6: New
217.7: York
217.7: City.

218.3: It
218.7: did
218.7: not
219.0: work
219.2: out
219.4: for
219.6: her,

219.5: granted,
220.1: she
220.3: passed
220.7: away,
220.9: unfortunately.

221.1: But
221.9: we
222.2: gave
222.4: him
222.5: that
222.7: opportunity.

223.5: You
223.8: know
223.9: what
224.0: I
224.0: am
224.1: saying?

225.2: It
225.3: is
225.4: just
225.8: about
225.9: setting
226.4: up
226.5: the
226.6: right
226.8: team,

227.1: and
227.3: then
227.4: overnight
228.2: your
228.5: life
228.7: can
228.9: change.

235.0: What
235.2: does...
235.4: What
235.6: does
235.8: an
236.0: intern...

239.0: What
239.2: does
239.4: an
239.6: intern
239.8: make
240.0: in
240.2: a
240.4: deal
240.6: like
240.8: that?

240.9: Well,
241.2: in
241.3: that
241.4: situation,

243.9: in
244.1: that
244.3: particular
244.5: trade,
244.7: and
244.9: it
245.1: was
245.3: one
245.5: trade,

247.5: north
248.0: of
248.1: half
248.4: a
248.4: million
248.7: dollars.

253.4: And
253.5: I
254.0: would
254.6: do
254.8: that
254.9: for
255.1: anybody,
255.5: you
255.7: know,

255.9: anybody
256.5: that
256.6: needs
257.4: the
257.4: proper
257.6: guidance.

278.3: Can
278.8: you
279.0: say
279.3: that
279.6: again,

280.8: just
281.3: the
281.5: way
281.7: you
281.8: said
282.0: it?

282.9: Just
283.4: the
283.5: same
283.7: way.

286.3: Oh.

288.8: I
289.2: do
289.2: not
289.3: know
289.4: what
289.5: you
289.7: are
289.9: talking
290.1: about.

289.8: Oh,
290.0: come
290.2: on!
290.4: You
290.6: know
290.8: what
291.0: I
291.2: am
291.4: talking
291.6: about.

292.3: I
292.4: think
293.0: what
293.1: Jordan
293.4: just
293.6: did
293.8: is
294.0: he...

294.3: If
294.5: I

295.3: No.

295.3: you

296.4: to
296.5: bribe
296.8: a
297.2: federal

297.7: No,
297.9: technically
298.1: I
298.3: did
298.5: not
298.7: bribe
298.9: anybody.

299.9: No,
300.2: no,
300.5: that

303.4: U.S.
303.6: criminal
303.8: code,

303.9: there

305.1: dollar
305.3: figure

306.2: for
306.3: the
306.4: exchange
306.6: of
306.9: services.
307.1: Oh!

307.6: That

308.3: up
308.6: in

308.8: of
309.1: law.

309.2: Nah,
309.4: it
309.6: is
309.8: not
310.0: howl
310.2: heard
310.4: it.

310.9: No,
311.0: no,
311.2: no,
311.3: that
311.5: is
312.1: the
312.3: truth.
312.7: But
312.8: I
313.3: want
313.5: to
313.6: tell
313.7: you
313.9: this.

313.7: Yeah.

314.7: The
315.0: same
315.4: gentleman
315.8: that
316.1: told
316.3: me

316.6: that
316.8: you
317.0: tried
317.3: to
317.3: get
317.5: your
317.7: broker's
317.9: license

318.4: also
318.6: told
319.0: me
319.1: that
319.2: you
319.3: are
319.5: a
319.6: straight
320.0: arrow.

320.5: He
320.7: ran
320.9: a
321.2: security
321.6: check
321.9: on
322.0: me.

322.0: Well...

323.3: Yeah,
323.3: when
323.3: you

325.0: a
325.1: boat
325.1: fit
325.6: for
325.7: a
325.8: Bond
326.1: villain,

326.5: sometimes
327.1: you
327.1: need
327.2: to
327.3: play
327.5: the
327.7: part.
327.9: Right?

329.9: I
330.2: think
330.2: it
330.4: is
330.5: time
330.6: you
330.8: both
330.8: get
331.1: the
331.2: fuck

331.9: What
332.1: do
332.3: you
332.5: say?
332.7: Hmm?

334.2: You
334.6: know,
334.8: Jordan,
335.0: I

341.9: right?
342.1: Yeah.

342.4: Their
343.1: fathers
343.5: are
343.7: douchebags,

344.5: just
344.9: like
345.0: their
345.2: fathers
345.6: before
345.8: them.

347.3: But
347.7: you...

350.5: You,
