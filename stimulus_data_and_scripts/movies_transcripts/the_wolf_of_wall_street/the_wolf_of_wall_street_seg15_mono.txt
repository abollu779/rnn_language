15.2: sold,
15.4: okay.

15.6: It
15.7: is
15.8: not
15.9: coming
16.2: from
16.3: us,
16.5: so
16.7: it
16.9: is
17.1: gotta
17.3: be
17.4: Steve.

17.7: He
17.9: is
18.1: the
18.3: only
18.5: person
18.7: with

26.6: yet.

26.8: Let's
27.0: not
27.2: jump
27.4: to

112.6: stuck
113.1: in
113.2: a
113.3: Swiss
113.7: bank
113.8: account.

114.3: The
114.5: last
114.7: time
114.9: I
115.1: talked
115.3: to
115.5: her
115.7: she

117.5: Oh,
117.7: God!
117.9: Baby,

136.0: probate
136.3: or
136.4: what?

136.5: Not
136.7: to
136.9: worry,
137.1: Jordan.
137.3: Not
137.5: to
137.7: worry.

138.2: Your

139.2: before
139.4: she
139.6: died,

140.0: signed
140.5: a
140.6: document
140.9: naming
141.3: you
141.6: as
141.9: her
142.1: successor.

144.8: Fantastic!
145.7: Well,
145.7: that
145.8: is
146.0: good
146.2: news!

146.7: Well,

150.2: mean?
150.4: Not
150.6: as

170.7: Please.
170.9: Okay.

171.7: Move
171.9: my
172.1: ass!
172.3: Yes!

173.6: I
173.8: gotta
174.2: say,
174.4: these
174.6: Swiss
174.8: were
175.3: some
175.6: sneaky
175.8: motherfuckers.

177.9: Within
178.5: minutes,
178.7: he
179.0: had
179.1: me
179.2: set
179.5: up
179.6: with
179.7: a
179.9: forger

180.3: who
180.4: could
180.6: fake
180.9: Aunt
181.1: Emma's
181.4: signature.

182.1: You
182.3: American
182.5: shit!

183.7: I
184.0: just

185.0: tomorrow,

185.6: or
185.8: lose
186.0: $20
186.2: million.

187.3: We
187.5: are
187.7: going
187.9: to
188.1: Monaco!

189.4: Monaco?
189.6: Now?
189.8: Yes,
190.0: baby.

191.9: We
192.1: are
192.3: going
192.5: to
192.7: Monaco,
192.9: so
193.1: then
193.3: we
193.5: can
193.7: go
193.9: to
194.1: Switzerland,
194.3: okay?

194.6: But
194.8: her
195.0: aunt
195.2: just
195.4: died.
195.6: I
195.8: realize
196.0: that.

196.2: But
196.8: I
196.8: have
197.0: business
197.2: in
197.4: Switzerland.

197.6: I

208.1: Yeah,

211.5: anyone
212.1: in
212.2: the
212.3: entire
212.7: world.

212.5: I
213.1: really
213.4: did.

214.7: But
214.9: she
215.1: is
215.3: dead
215.5: now,
215.7: sweetie.

217.0: She

217.5: and
217.7: she
217.9: is
218.1: not

218.6: anywhere.

219.4: She
219.4: will
219.7: still
219.9: be
220.0: dead
220.1: by
220.4: the
220.6: time

220.6: we

231.0: business
231.2: here,
231.3: we
231.4: will

235.1: York
235.3: in
235.5: three
235.7: fucking

236.1: days!

235.8: That
236.0: is
236.2: the
236.4: fucking
236.6: plan.

236.9: I
237.0: just
237.1: want
237.3: you
237.3: to
237.4: know
237.4: that
237.5: we
237.9: might
238.6: run
238.8: into
239.0: some

239.6: Chop?
239.8: We
240.0: can
240.2: fucking

243.2: yacht.

243.4: No,
243.5: no,
243.6: no.
243.7: We

245.4: is
245.6: safe,
245.8: all
246.0: right.

246.2: Do
246.4: not
246.6: worry
246.8: about
247.0: the
247.2: chop.
247.4: It
247.6: is
247.8: safe.

247.7: You
247.9: do
248.1: not
248.3: know
248.5: shit
248.7: about
248.9: chop.

249.0: Oh,

418.7: by
418.9: Italians

419.8: is
420.0: that
420.2: they

422.2: wine,

423.5: then
423.9: you
424.0: get
424.1: to
424.2: dance.

442.0: Did
442.2: you
442.4: see
442.6: that?

444.1: That
444.4: was
444.8: the
444.8: plane
445.3: I
445.4: sent
445.7: to
445.8: come
446.1: get
446.2: us.

447.9: I
448.1: shit
448.3: you
448.6: not,
448.8: it
449.0: exploded

449.6: when
449.8: a
450.1: seagull
450.4: flew
450.7: into
450.9: the
451.0: engine.

451.8: Three
452.0: people
452.2: killed.

458.0: You
458.1: want
458.3: a
458.5: sign
458.8: from
458.9: God?

459.9: Well,
460.2: after
460.5: all
460.6: this,
460.8: I
461.0: finally
461.5: got
461.6: the
461.8: message.

468.4: Do
468.8: you
468.9: dream
469.2: of
469.4: becoming
469.6: financially
470.3: independent

472.2: but
472.4: struggle
472.6: every
472.8: month
473.0: just
473.2: to
473.4: pay
473.6: your
473.8: bills?

474.9: Would
475.2: you
475.3: like
475.5: to
475.6: own
475.7: a
475.9: home
476.1: like
476.4: this,

476.8: but
477.2: can
477.3: barely
477.5: afford
477.7: to
478.0: pay
478.2: your
478.4: rent?

479.0: My
479.4: name
479.7: is
479.8: Jordan
480.1: Belfort,

480.7: and
481.1: there
481.2: is
481.3: no
481.5: secret
481.7: to
482.0: wealth
482.2: creation.

482.9: No
483.2: matter
483.4: who
483.6: you
483.7: are,

484.1: no
484.4: matter
484.6: where
484.7: you
484.9: came
485.3: from,

485.4: you
485.9: too
486.3: can
486.4: become
486.5: financially
487.6: independent

488.1: in
488.4: just
488.6: a
488.9: matter
488.9: of
489.3: months.

489.9: All
490.4: you
490.5: need
490.8: is
491.4: a
491.6: strategy.

492.2: When
492.4: I
492.6: was
492.8: 24
493.1: years
493.4: old,

493.7: I
494.1: made
494.4: a
494.5: decision
494.7: not
495.4: just
495.6: to
495.8: survive,
496.3: but
496.7: to
497.1: thrive.

497.6: At
497.8: first
498.4: I
498.4: did
498.4: not
498.6: feel
498.7: like
498.9: deals
499.2: like
499.6: these
499.7: were
499.9: possible.

500.1: But
500.3: we
500.5: have
500.7: the
501.0: house
501.4: and
501.5: we
501.7: have
501.9: a
502.0: $33,000
503.1: profit.

503.8: I
504.1: certainly
504.5: believe
504.8: now.

504.9: Think
505.5: about
505.6: it
505.8: for
505.8: a
505.9: second.

506.5: If
506.8: you
506.9: do
506.9: not
507.0: have
507.1: the
507.2: guts
507.3: to
507.6: attend
508.0: Jordan
508.2: Belfort's

508.5: Straight
509.1: Line
509.4: Persuasion
509.6: System
510.0: seminar,

511.1: then
511.5: how
511.6: do
511.7: you
511.7: expect
512.0: to
512.1: make
512.2: any
512.4: money?

512.7: If
512.9: you
513.1: want
513.3: to
513.5: be
513.7: a
513.9: millionaire
514.1: someday,

514.4: have
514.5: some
514.9: guts.
515.3: Make
515.7: a
515.8: decision.

516.4: Jordan
516.7: Belfort's
517.0: setup
517.3: worked
517.7: for
517.7: me

517.9: because
518.1: I
518.3: worked
518.6: hard
518.8: for
518.9: it.

519.3: And
519.3: if
519.8: it
519.9: does
519.9: not
520.1: work
520.2: for
520.4: you,

520.9: it
521.1: is
521.4: because
521.6: you
521.6: are
521.7: lazy.

522.0: And
522.2: you
522.4: should
522.6: get
522.8: a
523.0: job
523.2: at
523.4: McDonald's.

523.3: There
523.5: is
523.7: nobody
523.9: holding
524.1: you
524.3: back
524.5: from
524.7: financial
524.9: freedom.

526.2: And
526.2: there
526.3: is
526.7: nobody
527.0: stopping
527.6: you
527.6: from
527.9: making
528.1: millions.

529.2: Do
529.2: not
529.6: just
529.7: sit
529.9: at
530.0: home,

530.5: or
530.7: the
530.9: life
531.1: of
531.3: your
531.5: dreams
531.9: will
532.0: sail
532.3: right
532.7: past
532.9: you.

535.9: I
536.1: changed
536.3: all
536.5: these
536.7: people's
536.9: lives

537.9: and
538.3: I
538.4: can
538.6: change
538.8: yours,
539.3: too!

539.6: So
539.8: come
540.0: to
540.2: my
540.4: seminar!

540.9: The
541.1: life
541.3: of
541.5: your
541.7: dreams
541.9: is
542.1: only...

542.4: Good
542.6: to
542.8: see
543.0: you
543.2: again,
543.4: Jordan.

544.2: You
544.4: are
544.6: under
544.8: arrest!

545.4: You
545.6: gotta
545.8: be
546.0: joking!

548.2: You
548.4: are
548.6: kidding
548.8: me.

549.5: Hey,
