2.1: Big
2.3: fucking
2.5: deal
2.7: I
2.9: look
3.1: great.

4.9: Mr.
5.1: Belfort!
5.3: Can
5.5: you
5.7: look
5.9: at
6.1: my
6.3: resume,
6.5: please?

6.3: Excuse
6.5: me,
6.7: excuse
6.9: me,
7.1: sir!

10.6: Calm
10.8: the
11.0: fuck
11.2: down!

12.7: What
12.9: the
13.1: hell's
13.3: all
13.5: this?

14.2: It
14.4: is
14.6: the
14.8: Forbes
15.0: article.
15.2: They
15.4: all
15.6: want
15.8: to
16.0: work
16.2: for
16.4: you
16.6: now.

17.1: Hey!
17.3: What
17.5: did
17.7: I
17.9: say?

18.2: I
18.4: am
18.6: just
18.8: trying
19.0: to
19.2: be
19.4: nice.

19.8: Hey,
20.0: you
20.2: want
20.4: a
20.6: job,
20.8: you
21.0: talk
21.2: to
21.4: me!

22.7: Mr.
22.9: Belfort!
23.1: Give
23.3: me
23.5: one
23.7: minute.

23.9: Forbes
24.3: made
24.8: me
24.9: a
25.0: superstar.

27.8: Every
28.5: day,
28.8: dozens
29.4: of
29.5: money-crazed
30.4: kids
30.8: beat
31.0: a
31.1: path
31.3: to
31.6: my
31.8: door.

33.7: If
34.0: we
34.1: hired
34.3: 'em,
34.6: they
34.9: dropped
35.2: straight
35.7: out
35.8: of
35.9: college
36.1: overnight

36.6: and
37.0: spent
37.1: whatever
37.5: allowance
37.9: they
38.1: had

38.5: on
38.6: a
38.7: new
38.9: suit
39.4: from
39.5: our
39.7: Stratton
39.9: tailor.

40.8: Are
41.0: you
41.2: fucking
41.4: serious
41.6: right
41.8: now?

42.8: I
42.8: mean,
42.8: we
42.8: were
42.9: literally
44.2: putting
44.5: clothes
45.1: on
45.2: these
45.5: kids'
45.8: backs.

46.6: And
47.0: here
47.1: comes
47.3: this
47.6: jerk-off
48.1: sniffing
48.5: around.

50.0: But,
50.2: you
50.3: know,
50.4: every
51.1: time
51.3: someone
51.5: rises
52.1: up
52.2: in
52.4: this
52.5: world,

52.9: there
52.9: is
53.3: always
53.6: gonna
54.0: be
54.0: some
54.4: asshole
54.8: trying
55.2: to
55.2: drag
55.6: him
55.7: down.

57.7: Within
57.9: months,
58.2: we
58.6: doubled
58.9: in
59.3: size,

59.9: moved
60.1: to
60.4: even
60.7: bigger
61.1: offices.

69.1: It
69.3: was
69.5: a
69.6: madhouse.

70.8: A
71.0: greed-fest,

72.1: with
72.5: equal
72.9: parts
73.4: cocaine,
74.0: testosterone,
74.5: and
75.1: body
75.3: fluids.

76.4: Yes!

78.5: It
78.8: got
79.0: so
79.1: bad,
79.4: I
80.0: had
80.1: to
80.1: declare
80.5: the
80.6: office
80.9: a
81.2: fuck-free
81.3: zone

82.1: between
82.8: the
82.9: hours
83.2: of
83.4: 9:00
83.7: and
83.9: 7:00.

84.3: But
84.4: I
84.6: am
84.8: telling
85.0: you,
85.2: even
85.4: that
85.6: did
86.0: not
86.2: help.

87.1: Actually,
87.5: the
87.6: madness
88.1: started
88.5: on
88.6: our
88.8: very
89.1: first
89.5: day,

90.1: when
90.3: one
90.5: of
90.7: our
90.9: brokers,
91.1: Ben
91.3: Jenner,

91.5: christened
92.3: the
92.4: elevator
93.0: by
93.1: getting
93.4: a
93.5: blowjob

94.0: from
94.2: a
94.3: sales
94.7: assistant.

95.5: Her
95.7: name
95.9: was
96.1: Pam,
96.4: and
96.6: to
96.8: her
97.1: credit,

97.5: she
97.7: did
97.9: have
98.1: this
98.3: amazing
98.5: technique,

99.8: with
100.1: this
100.5: wild
100.8: twist
101.2: and
101.6: jerk
101.9: motion.

103.0: About
103.4: a
103.4: month
103.7: later,

103.9: Donnie
104.8: and
105.0: I
105.0: decided
105.5: to
105.6: double-team
105.8: her

106.1: on
106.2: a
106.3: Saturday
107.0: afternoon

107.4: while
107.6: our
107.8: wives
108.0: were
108.2: out
108.5: shopping
108.9: for
109.0: Christmas
109.2: dresses.

110.4: Eventually,
111.0: Ben
111.6: married
111.8: her,

112.0: which
112.2: was
112.5: pretty
113.0: amazing
113.5: considering
114.0: she
114.3: blew

114.2: every
115.0: single
115.2: guy
115.6: in
115.7: the
115.8: office.

117.0: Then
117.3: he
117.6: got
117.9: depressed
118.3: and
118.4: killed
118.7: himself
118.9: three
119.2: years
119.4: later.

120.4: Anyway,
121.0: I
121.3: hired
121.7: my
121.8: dad,
122.1: Max,
122.5: to
122.6: maintain
123.2: order
123.4: as
123.7: the
123.9: Enforcer.

125.0: Stratton's
125.7: very
126.1: own
126.3: Gestapo.

128.2: We
128.4: called
128.6: him
128.9: Mad
129.3: Max
129.7: because
130.0: of
130.1: his
130.3: hair-trigger
130.7: temper,

131.3: which
131.7: could
131.9: be
132.0: set
132.2: off
132.4: by
132.6: something

132.8: as
133.1: innocuous
133.5: as
133.9: a
134.0: ringing
134.4: telephone.

136.4: Who
136.8: the
137.2: fuck
137.6: has
138.0: the
138.4: goddamn
138.6: gall

139.1: to
139.3: call
139.5: this
139.7: house
139.9: on
140.1: a
140.3: Tuesday
140.5: night?

142.0: God
142.2: damn
142.4: it!

144.1: You
144.3: are
144.5: gonna
144.7: miss
144.9: it!

145.2: Ooh,
145.4: please,
145.6: tell
145.8: me
146.0: something
146.2: I
146.4: do
146.6: not
146.8: know.

147.1: I
147.3: wait
147.5: all
147.7: week
147.9: for
148.1: the
148.3: fucking
148.5: Equalizer

149.9: and
150.1: they
150.3: have
150.5: to
150.7: fucking...
150.9: Hello.

152.1: But
152.4: as
152.8: soon
152.9: as
153.0: he
153.1: picked
153.3: up
153.6: the
153.6: phone...

154.1: Gene.
154.7: How
155.0: are
155.2: you,
155.4: Gene?

155.5: he
155.7: would
155.9: affect
156.1: this
156.3: weird
156.5: British
156.7: accent.

157.4: Right-o,
158.3: Gene,
158.6: that
158.6: would
158.7: be
158.9: great.

160.1: Cheerio.

161.1: It
161.2: was
161.3: absolutely
162.0: bizarre.

162.2: The
162.4: fucking
162.6: halfwit!

163.9: He
164.1: would
164.3: hang
164.5: up...
164.7: You
164.9: missed
165.1: it!

165.0: and
165.2: then
165.4: he
165.6: is
165.8: Mad
166.0: Max
166.2: all
166.4: over
166.6: again.

167.4: Damn
167.6: it!

168.5: All
168.7: right,
168.9: tell
169.1: me
169.3: what
169.5: happened.
169.7: What
169.9: happened?

170.8: Well,
171.3: he
171.4: discovered
172.1: it
172.2: was
172.3: the
172.5: mother's
172.7: sister.

173.0: Who
173.2: is
173.4: he?
173.6: Who?
173.8: Tell
174.0: me
174.2: who...

174.5: The
174.7: main
174.9: guy.
175.1: You
175.3: know
175.5: who
175.7: the
175.9: main...

176.1: The
176.3: main
176.5: guy...

177.3: it
177.5: was
177.7: his
177.9: mother's
178.1: sister.
178.3: She
178.5: showed
178.7: up
178.9: dead.

181.1: Of
181.3: course,
181.6: Mad
182.1: Max
182.5: did
182.5: not
182.8: have
183.0: to
183.2: know

183.0: everything
183.4: we
183.6: were
183.8: doing
183.8: at
184.1: Stratton.

184.6: And
184.6: then
184.8: there
185.1: is
185.2: a
185.3: big
185.5: target
185.8: and
186.2: we...

186.8: They
187.1: get
187.3: launched
187.6: at
187.8: the
188.0: target.
188.2: They
188.4: stick.

188.7: There
188.7: is
188.8: a
189.0: bull's-eye
189.6: and
189.9: the
190.1: bull's-eye's
190.3: a
190.5: dollar
190.7: sign.

190.9: Whoever
191.1: gets
191.3: closer
191.5: to
191.7: the
191.9: dollar
192.1: sign...

192.4: gets
192.8: the
192.8: most
193.0: points.

193.1: I
193.2: am
193.3: gonna
193.4: throw
193.5: the
193.6: shit
193.9: out
194.0: of
194.1: this
194.2: little
194.4: fucking
194.6: thing.

195.4: So
195.6: if
195.8: it
196.1: gets
196.4: hurt,
196.8: what
197.0: happens?

197.4: 'Cause
197.6: we
197.8: are
198.0: gonna
198.2: get
198.4: fucking
198.6: nuts.

198.5: I
198.6: do
198.6: not
198.9: think
198.9: he
199.0: is
199.2: gonna
199.4: get
199.5: hurt.
199.7: They
199.9: are
200.1: like...

200.3: They
200.5: got
200.6: like
200.8: superhuman
201.3: strength.

201.8: I
202.1: think
202.1: he
202.2: is
202.3: gonna
202.5: be
202.6: fine.

203.3: You
203.5: can
203.7: not
203.9: look
204.1: him
204.3: right
204.5: in
204.7: the
204.9: eyes.

205.3: You
205.5: can
205.7: not
205.9: look
206.1: him
206.3: in
206.5: the
206.7: eye?

206.5: That
206.7: is
206.9: a
207.1: fact.
207.3: I
207.5: saw
207.7: it
207.9: on
208.1: PBS.

208.1: They
208.3: get
208.5: confused
208.8: and
209.1: their
209.4: wires
209.7: get
210.0: crossed.

210.4: You
210.6: gotta
210.8: look
211.0: at
211.2: their
211.4: chin.

211.8: Like
212.1: it
212.2: looks
212.3: like
212.5: I
212.5: am
212.7: looking
212.8: at
213.0: you

213.0: but
213.7: I
213.9: am
214.1: looking
214.3: at
214.5: your
214.7: chin.

214.1: I
214.3: feel
214.5: like
214.7: you
214.9: are
215.1: addressing
215.3: me
215.5: right
215.7: now,
215.9: but
216.1: you
216.3: are
216.5: not,
216.7: are
216.9: you?

216.3: They
216.5: are
216.7: like
216.9: the
217.1: Mona
217.3: Lisa.
217.5: They
217.7: find
217.9: eye
218.1: contact,

218.6: like,
218.7: wherever
219.0: you
219.0: are
219.2: standing
219.5: in
219.7: the
219.8: room.

220.0: And
220.0: they
220.0: lock
220.1: in.

221.3: No,
221.5: but
221.7: there
221.9: is
222.1: a
222.3: limit
222.5: to
222.7: what
222.9: we
223.1: can
223.3: do
223.5: with
223.7: them?

223.8: We
223.8: are
224.0: allowed
224.3: to
224.5: throw
224.7: shit
224.9: at
225.1: 'em.

225.1: We
225.3: are
225.5: allowed
225.7: to
225.9: throw
226.1: food?
226.3: Bananas.

226.6: Any
226.8: food.
227.0: Correct.

227.9: But,
228.1: for
228.3: example,
228.4: what
228.8: I
228.9: would
228.9: not
229.2: do
229.4: is

229.5: maybe
229.7: like
229.8: tell
229.9: him
230.0: to
230.1: pull
230.4: his
230.6: cock
230.9: out

231.2: and
231.3: like
231.5: get
231.7: some
231.9: of
232.0: the
232.0: girls
232.3: to,
232.6: you
232.8: know,

232.7: fondle
232.9: him
233.2: and
233.5: shit
233.8: like
234.0: that.

234.1: That
234.3: would
234.5: be...
234.7: That
234.9: is
235.1: unacceptable?

235.2: Let's
235.4: keep
235.6: that
235.8: in
236.0: our
236.2: back
236.4: pocket.

236.0: This
236.6: guy
236.8: is
237.0: more
237.2: about
237.4: throwing
237.6: at
237.8: the
238.0: dartboard.

238.3: Correct.
238.5: Yes,
238.7: yes,
238.9: yes.

239.5: The
239.6: thing
239.8: is,
240.0: this
240.1: is
240.2: their
240.4: gift,
240.8: okay.

241.0: They
241.0: are
241.2: built
241.6: to
241.9: be
242.1: thrown
242.3: like
242.5: a
242.6: lawn
242.8: dart.

242.8: They
242.8: are
243.1: top
243.4: heavy
243.7: like
243.9: a
243.9: lawn
244.1: dart.

244.3: So
244.5: they
244.7: are
244.9: built
245.1: for
245.3: accuracy.

245.2: Oh,
245.5: my
245.7: God.
246.7: Can
246.8: we
246.8: bowl
247.1: with
247.2: this
247.3: guy?

263.7: very
263.8: careful
264.0: with
264.2: these

278.2: loophole.
278.4: Right?
278.6: Okay?

279.3: If

281.2: human,

281.3: we

281.8: consider
281.9: it
282.1: an
282.3: act,
282.5: I
282.7: think
282.9: we
283.1: are
283.3: in
283.5: the
283.7: clear.

283.6: Like
283.9: The

286.5: they
286.7: never

286.8: The
287.0: important
287.2: thing
287.4: you
287.6: guys
287.8: gotta
288.0: keep

290.5: They
291.0: get
291.2: together
291.4: and
291.6: they
291.8: gossip.

292.2: That
292.3: is
292.5: a
292.6: good
292.8: point.
293.0: And
293.2: the
293.4: last
293.6: thing

293.8: that
294.0: we
294.2: need
294.6: is
295.0: them
295.2: getting
295.5: together
295.5: and
295.7: saying,

295.9: "Oh,

440.1: there
440.4: were

444.0: They
444.6: cost
444.9: between
445.2: $300
445.5: and
445.7: $500

445.8: and

446.3: had
446.5: to
446.6: wear
446.6: a

447.0: unless

447.8: gave
447.9: them
448.1: a
