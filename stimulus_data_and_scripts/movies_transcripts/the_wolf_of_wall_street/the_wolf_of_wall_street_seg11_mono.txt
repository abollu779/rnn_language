188.3: is
188.6: also
188.9: a
189.3: crime
189.8: in
190.0: Switzerland.

190.7: But
191.1: there
191.3: are
191.4: very
191.5: few
191.7: Swiss
191.9: laws
192.5: which
192.8: apply
193.2: to
193.5: your
193.7: practices.

195.1: Hmm.

196.2: From
196.5: a
196.6: financial
196.8: standpoint,

198.0: you
198.5: are
198.7: now

199.9: in

204.8: Justice
205.2: Department
205.4: sent
205.9: us
206.5: a
206.5: subpoena,
206.7: it
207.8: would
208.0: become

208.9: papier
209.1: toilette.

211.5: We
211.9: would
212.0: wipe
212.3: our
212.5: ass
212.7: with
212.9: it.

214.1: Unless,
215.0: of
215.1: course,
215.2: it
216.0: was
216.2: an
216.4: investigation

217.4: into
217.6: stock
217.9: fraud,

218.9: which
219.0: is
219.6: a
219.6: crime
219.9: here
220.1: in
220.2: Switzerland,
220.4: if
220.8: I
220.8: am
220.9: correct.

221.0: Then
221.7: there
222.5: would
222.6: have
222.7: to
223.0: be
223.7: coopération
224.4: on
225.1: your
225.3: part,

225.1: if
225.3: I
225.3: am
225.8: not
225.9: mistaken.
226.1: Yes.

227.5: Yes,
228.0: we
228.3: would.
228.5: Mmm-hmm.

230.1: Assuming
230.9: the
231.1: account
231.5: is
231.6: under
231.8: your
232.0: name.

234.0: If
234.2: it
234.4: were

235.7: another
236.3: name,

238.0: a
238.0: friend's,
238.2: camarade...

239.6: Cousin?

245.7: Relative?
245.9: Yeah.

247.9: Hmm.

249.6: Was
250.1: that
250.3: yodeling
251.2: I
251.4: just

252.6: you
252.8: just
253.0: say
253.2: what
253.4: I
253.6: thought
253.8: you

254.8: Yes.
255.0: Yes.

257.3: He

257.7: telling
257.9: me
258.1: to
258.3: use
258.5: a
258.7: fucking
258.9: rathole.

260.0: But
260.3: a
260.6: U.S.
260.8: rathole
261.0: would
261.2: never
261.4: get

262.2: into
262.3: Switzerland
262.7: with
263.0: all
263.2: that
263.3: money.

263.9: What
264.1: I
264.7: needed
265.0: was
265.4: a
265.8: rathole
266.3: with
266.4: a
266.6: European
267.3: passport.

275.2: Jordan.

276.5: Hey.

281.2: Oh,

282.0: not
282.4: at
282.5: all.

285.3: Jordan,

285.7: in.

287.3: Thank
287.8: God
288.0: Aunt
288.3: Emma
288.6: did
288.6: not
288.8: need
289.0: too
289.1: much
289.3: convincing.

290.1: Turned
290.9: out
291.0: the
291.1: British
291.5: were
291.6: not
291.7: too
291.8: different
291.9: from
292.1: the
292.4: Swiss.

292.7: Money
293.5: talks
294.0: and
294.1: bullshit
294.7: takes
295.0: the
295.2: bus.

295.7: How
296.4: do
296.5: you
296.5: say
296.9: "rathole"
297.3: in
297.4: British?

298.2: If
298.4: you
298.6: get
298.8: into
299.0: any
299.2: trouble
299.4: whatsoever,

300.7: I
301.0: will
301.3: come
301.6: forth
301.9: immediately.
302.0: I
302.3: will
302.5: say
302.7: that
302.9: I
303.1: duped
303.3: you.

303.6: That
304.1: I
304.2: promise.

305.8: Risk
306.1: is
306.4: what
306.5: keeps
306.7: us
306.8: young,
307.0: is
307.2: not
307.4: it,
307.6: darling?

312.7: Sometimes
313.5: I
313.6: wonder

314.8: if
315.1: you
315.4: let
315.6: money
315.9: get
316.0: the
316.1: best
316.4: of
316.4: you,
316.5: my
316.7: love.

318.0: Among

319.5: other
319.9: substances.

321.5: Oh.

325.3: It
325.5: is
325.7: that
325.9: obvious,
326.1: huh?

326.8: It
326.8: is
326.9: chilly,
327.2: darling,
327.7: and
327.8: you
328.0: are
328.2: sweating
328.8: bullets.

332.8: What
332.8: can
333.0: I
333.2: say?
333.3: I'm...

335.6: I
335.6: am
336.0: a
336.1: drug
336.4: addict.

337.3: I
337.5: really
337.7: am.

339.7: Cocaine,
340.5: pills.

341.9: Whatever
342.2: it
342.5: is,
342.6: I
342.7: will
342.9: fucking
343.3: do
343.5: it.

344.9: Now
345.0: that
345.1: is
345.6: the
345.7: truth.

346.7: I
346.9: mean...

348.0: I
348.0: am
348.0: a
348.1: sex
348.8: addict,
349.0: too.

350.3: Well,

355.3: you
355.3: all
355.4: this?
355.6: Why
355.8: am
356.0: I...

356.3: I
356.3: am
356.9: sorry.

358.8: Because
359.3: I

365.8: it's...

367.0: Just
367.8: my
367.9: job,
368.1: you

369.4: All
369.9: these
370.1: people
370.3: dependent
371.0: on
371.2: me.

371.4: Tens
371.6: of

372.0: of
372.2: dollars
372.3: at

393.6: that
393.7: on
393.8: myself
394.0: though,
394.5: right?

395.4: My
395.8: decision.

397.5: It
397.6: is
397.7: just
397.9: hard
398.3: to...

399.1: Hard
399.5: to
399.9: learn
400.3: to
400.7: control
401.1: the

403.6: You
404.0: know,
404.2: to...

405.4: Learn
405.9: to
406.0: relax
406.5: and
407.1: let
407.3: go
407.5: and...

409.0: To
409.1: release
409.8: the
409.9: tension.

412.2: She

412.9: hitting
413.1: on
413.3: me.

414.7: Holy
415.3: shit!

416.2: Yeah,
416.2: to
416.3: release
417.0: the
417.2: tension.

422.3: I
422.5: suppose
422.7: we,
422.9: uh...

424.6: We
424.9: all
425.1: just
425.4: need
425.5: to
425.6: learn,
425.8: uh...

427.5: Learn
428.1: to
428.2: do
428.3: what
428.4: comes
428.6: naturally
429.2: in
429.3: life,
429.6: you
429.7: know?

432.7: Is
432.7: he
432.8: fucking
433.2: hitting
433.7: on
434.2: me?

441.5: Stability,
