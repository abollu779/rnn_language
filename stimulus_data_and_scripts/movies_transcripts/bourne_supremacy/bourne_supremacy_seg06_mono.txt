41.2: nightmare.

41.5: There

43.7: Call
43.9: a

51.1: him
51.3: off,
51.5: and
51.7: I

51.7: You

52.2: not
52.5: really
52.7: believe
52.8: he
53.1: wants
53.4: to

53.6: He
53.8: knows
54.0: something
54.4: about
54.5: the
54.8: Neski
54.8: case.

55.1: And
55.9: I

56.6: this
56.7: chance
56.9: to
57.2: find
57.4: out
57.5: what
57.7: it
57.9: is.

57.7: Do

57.9: be
58.1: a
58.3: fool.
58.5: Not
58.7: when
58.9: we
58.9: are

59.9: talking
60.1: about
60.3: protecting
60.5: Nicky
60.7: or
60.9: killing
61.1: Bourne?

61.7: We
61.7: are
62.2: talking
62.4: about
62.6: killing
62.8: Bourne.

63.1: We
63.1: are
63.5: talking
63.9: about
64.0: the
64.1: next
64.3: dead
64.5: body.

64.9: It
64.9: might
65.0: be
65.1: Nicky.
65.3: It
65.6: will
65.6: be
65.8: someone.

66.2: You
66.2: are
66.4: not
66.6: hearing
67.1: me.
67.6: Bourne
68.1: dead
68.6: gives
68.8: me
69.0: nothing.

72.9: Can
73.3: I
73.4: talk
73.6: to
73.6: you
73.7: privately?

81.9: What?
82.4: I
82.8: know
82.9: how
83.0: you
83.0: are
83.1: feeling.

83.7: You
83.9: lost
84.1: two
84.3: men
84.5: in
84.7: Berlin,
84.9: and
85.1: you
85.3: want
85.5: it
85.7: to
85.9: mean
86.1: something.

86.6: But
86.8: nothing
87.1: Bourne
87.3: gives
87.6: you
87.7: will
87.9: bring
88.0: your
88.1: men
88.3: back.

88.8: Nothing
89.3: in
89.4: those
89.7: files
90.0: makes
90.1: their
90.3: sacrifice
90.6: worthwhile.

91.2: You
91.8: have
92.0: to
92.1: let
92.2: go.

93.0: We
93.0: are
93.1: professionals.

94.2: When
94.4: an
94.6: operation
94.8: goes
95.0: bad,
95.2: we
95.4: tie
95.6: it
95.8: off.

96.6: If
96.8: there
97.0: is
97.2: something
97.4: you
97.6: are
97.8: not
98.0: telling

105.6: you
105.8: read
106.0: it
106.2: in

121.7: What
121.9: do
122.1: you
122.3: want
122.5: to
122.7: do?

125.1: Put
125.4: the
125.7: snipers
126.1: in
126.2: place.

127.5: If
127.9: things

365.7: me,
365.9: and
366.1: they
366.3: killed

382.2: me?

382.2: Please!
382.4: I

493.6: big
493.8: puddle

495.2: not
495.3: have
495.5: the
495.6: shoes
495.9: for

497.2: He

497.9: he
498.1: did
498.1: not
498.3: know
498.3: anything
498.4: about
498.6: Berlin.

498.8: He

499.2: that
499.4: Nicky
499.6: was
499.8: wearing
500.0: a
500.2: wire.

500.4: Do
500.4: not
500.9: you
501.0: think
501.1: that
501.2: was
501.4: for

501.6: benefit?

502.2: He
502.4: did
502.4: not
502.7: sound
502.8: like
503.0: a
503.1: man
503.4: in
503.6: control
504.2: to
504.3: me.

504.3: We
504.8: know
505.0: he
505.3: was
505.5: in
505.5: Berlin.

506.5: His
506.9: mind
507.4: is
507.5: broken.
507.7: We

508.8: Terminate
509.0: him?

509.9: You

510.4: been
510.5: pushing
510.7: that
511.0: agenda
511.0: ever
511.5: since
511.7: we
511.9: got
512.1: here.

512.1: He
512.3: also
512.5: said
512.7: you
512.9: were
513.1: running
513.3: Treadstone.
513.5: Should
513.7: we
513.9: believe
514.1: that,
514.3: too?

514.3: I
514.3: am
514.8: convinced
515.0: that
515.2: Bourne
515.4: knows
515.7: something.

515.8: He
516.2: knows
516.5: that
516.6: you
516.6: are
516.9: after
517.2: him

518.0: and
518.3: in
518.4: the
518.5: interest
519.0: of
519.0: self-preservation
519.4: you
520.5: might
520.7: start
521.0: with
521.1: that.

523.3: Check
523.6: on
523.8: those
523.8: photos.
524.0: Have
524.2: they
524.4: gone
524.6: out?

538.2: I
538.5: need

538.9: you
539.0: something.
