5.3: gonna
5.6: play
5.7: ball
5.8: one
6.1: way
6.2: or

6.3: other.

16.7: This

17.4: Nevins.

17.8: This

18.2: Tom
18.4: Cronin,
18.6: CI
18.8: Operations
19.0: Officer

21.8: a
22.0: Jason
22.2: Bourne

29.1: Back

30.5: I
30.5: understand.

76.9: He
77.1: has
77.3: been
77.5: detained.
77.7: Here
77.9: is
78.1: the
78.3: number.

79.5: He
79.7: is
79.9: being
80.1: interrogated
80.3: by
80.5: a
80.7: field
80.9: officer
81.1: out

97.5: Hello.

98.5: This
98.7: is
98.9: Pamela
99.1: Landy,
99.3: CI
99.5: Supervisor.

100.0: Where
100.2: do
100.4: we
100.6: stand?

101.9: I
102.4: think
103.0: he
103.5: got
104.1: away.

106.2: Damn
106.7: it.

108.8: Have
109.0: you
109.2: locked
109.4: down
109.6: the
109.8: area?

110.4: Locked
111.1: it
111.2: down?
111.4: No,
111.6: no.

112.1: This
112.3: is...
112.6: This
112.9: is
113.2: Italy.
113.5: They
114.6: do
114.6: not
114.7: exactly
114.9: lock
115.1: down.

115.5: How
115.5: long
115.5: have
115.6: you
115.6: worked
115.7: for
115.7: the
115.8: Agency?

116.7: Me?
117.5: For
117.6: four
117.8: years.

118.2: Well,
118.4: if
118.6: you
118.8: ever
119.0: wanna
119.2: make
119.4: it
119.6: to
119.8: five,

119.7: you
119.9: are
120.1: gonna
120.3: listen
120.5: to
120.7: me
120.9: real
121.1: close.

121.4: Jason
121.6: Bourne
121.8: is
122.0: armed
122.2: and
122.4: extremely
122.6: dangerous.

123.3: Last
123.5: week
123.7: in
123.9: Berlin,
124.1: he
124.5: assassinated
124.7: two
124.9: men,

125.4: one
125.6: a
125.8: highly
126.0: experienced
126.2: field
126.4: officer.

126.9: I
127.1: want
127.4: you
127.4: to
127.5: secure
127.8: that
128.1: area.

128.7: I
128.8: want
129.1: any
129.3: evidence
129.7: secured,
130.0: and
130.1: I
130.2: want
130.4: it
130.5: done
130.5: right
130.7: now.

130.9: Is
131.1: that
131.3: clear?
131.5: Yes,
131.7: sir...
131.9: Ma'am.

132.9: I
132.9: am
133.4: getting
133.6: on
133.7: a
133.7: plane
133.8: to
134.0: Berlin
134.3: in
134.4: 45
134.7: minutes

135.1: which
135.3: means
135.5: you
135.7: are
135.9: gonna
136.1: call
136.3: me
136.5: Back
136.7: in
136.9: 30.

136.8: And
136.9: when
137.0: I
137.2: ask
137.3: you
137.4: where
137.6: we
137.7: stand,
138.0: I
138.2: had
138.3: better
138.5: be
138.6: impressed.

143.9: Berlin?
144.3: I
144.7: already
145.1: have
145.3: a
145.5: team
145.7: in
145.9: place
146.1: there.

145.7: I
145.9: doubt
146.1: that
146.3: Bourne's
146.5: in
146.7: Naples
146.9: ready
147.1: to
147.3: start
147.5: a
147.7: family.

147.9: You
148.2: have
148.5: no
148.7: idea
149.3: what
149.4: you
149.5: are
149.6: getting
149.8: into.

149.9: Do
150.1: you
150.3: have
150.5: any
150.7: idea?
150.9: From
151.1: the
151.3: minute
151.5: he
151.7: left
151.9: Treadstone,

152.1: he
152.3: has
152.5: killed
152.7: and
152.9: eluded
153.1: every
153.3: single
153.5: person
153.7: that
153.9: you
154.1: have
154.3: sent
154.5: to
154.7: find
154.9: him.

154.8: So
154.9: you
155.0: read
155.2: a
155.3: couple
155.5: of
155.5: files
155.7: on
155.9: Jason
156.2: Bourne
156.3: and
156.4: that
156.6: makes
156.7: you
156.9: an
157.0: expert?

157.2: This
157.6: is
157.7: my
157.8: case,
158.0: Ward.

158.8: Enough.
160.5: I
160.9: want
161.1: you
161.2: both
161.3: on
161.5: that
161.6: plane.

162.2: We
162.6: are,
162.7: all
162.9: of
163.1: us,
163.2: going
163.4: to
163.5: do

163.7: what
163.9: we
164.1: were
164.3: either
164.5: too
164.7: lazy
164.9: or
165.1: inept
165.3: to
165.5: do
165.7: the
165.9: last
166.1: time
166.3: around.

166.7: We
166.7: are
166.9: gonna
167.0: find
167.2: this
167.4: son
167.7: of
167.8: a
167.9: bitch
168.0: and
168.2: take
168.4: him
168.6: down.

169.6: I
169.6: am
170.0: not
170.3: having
170.6: Jason
171.0: Bourne
171.3: destroy
171.6: any
172.0: more
172.2: of
172.3: this
172.4: agency.

173.4: Is
173.8: that
173.9: definitive
174.1: enough
174.5: for
174.7: you?

175.8: Yes.

181.6: Jason
181.7: Bourne
182.0: is
182.2: armed
182.8: and
183.0: extremely
183.0: dangerous.

184.0: Last
184.0: week
184.0: in
184.0: Berlin,
184.0: he
184.0: assassinated
184.2: two
184.4: men,

185.8: one
185.9: a
186.0: highly
186.1: experienced
186.3: field
186.5: officer.

187.7: I
187.9: want
188.1: that
188.3: area...

189.2: he
189.4: assassinated
189.6: two
189.8: men,

190.8: one
191.0: a
191.2: highly
191.4: experienced
191.6: field
191.8: officer.

192.3: I
192.5: want
192.7: that
192.9: area
193.1: secured.
193.3: I
193.5: want
193.7: any
193.9: evidence
194.1: secured,
194.3: and
194.5: I
194.7: want
194.9: it
195.1: done
195.3: right
195.5: now.

216.0: This
216.2: is
216.4: not
216.6: a
216.8: drill,
217.0: soldier.

221.5: This
221.7: is
221.9: not
222.1: a
222.4: drill,
222.7: soldier.

226.4: Are
226.6: we
226.8: clear
227.0: on
227.2: that?

302.7: You
302.9: would
303.1: been
303.2: working
303.5: at
303.7: Treadstone
304.0: for
304.2: three
304.5: years

305.7: and
305.9: your
306.2: cover
306.4: at
306.7: the
306.8: time
307.2: was
307.3: what?

308.0: That
308.5: I
308.6: was
308.7: an
308.8: American
309.2: student
309.5: in
309.6: Paris.

309.8: And
310.4: what
310.6: exactly
311.0: did
311.1: your
311.3: job
311.6: with
311.9: Treadstone
312.2: in
312.5: Paris
312.8: consist
313.1: of?

313.1: I
313.5: had
313.9: two
314.1: responsibilities.

314.8: One
315.0: was
315.3: to
315.4: coordinate
315.9: logistical
316.4: operations.

316.9: The
317.3: other
317.5: was
317.7: to
317.9: monitor
318.1: the
318.3: health
318.5: of
318.7: the
318.9: agents.

319.0: Health,
319.2: meaning
319.4: what?
319.6: Their
319.8: mental
320.0: health.

320.6: Because
321.6: of
321.7: what
321.8: they
321.9: had
322.0: been
322.2: through,

321.9: they
322.4: were
322.7: prone
322.9: to
323.0: a
323.1: variety
323.2: of
323.4: problems.

323.8: What
324.0: kind
324.3: of
324.4: problems?

326.0: Depression,
326.8: anger,
327.1: compulsive
327.8: behaviors.

329.1: They
329.5: had
329.7: physical
330.3: symptoms.

330.4: Headaches,
331.4: sensitivity
332.5: to
332.6: light.

332.8: Amnesia?
332.9: Before
333.7: Bourne?
334.6: No.

340.9: The
341.1: plane's
341.3: ready.

342.1: There
342.3: is
342.5: a
342.7: car
342.9: waiting
343.1: for
343.3: you.

343.4: Good
343.8: luck.

344.5: No.
344.7: You
344.9: were
345.1: his
345.3: local
345.5: contact.

345.9: You
346.0: were
346.1: with
346.2: him
346.4: the
346.6: night
346.9: Conklin
347.2: died.

347.5: You
347.6: are
347.7: coming
348.3: with
348.4: us.

412.9: Langley
413.2: pulled
413.5: an
413.8: image
413.9: out
414.0: of
414.1: Naples.
414.3: It
414.6: is
414.7: uploading
415.2: right
415.3: now.

416.4: It
416.4: is
416.4: coming
416.9: in
417.0: now.

419.4: I
419.6: need
419.8: clearance.

420.7: He
420.7: is
420.7: not
420.9: hiding,
421.1: that
421.3: is
421.5: for
421.7: sure.

422.0: Why
422.5: Naples?
422.7: Why
422.9: now?

423.3: Could
424.0: be
424.1: random.
424.3: Zoom
424.5: in.

425.0: Maybe
425.1: he
425.2: is
425.4: running.
425.7: On
426.0: his
426.1: own
426.3: passport?

426.8: What
427.0: is
427.2: he
427.4: actually
427.6: doing?

428.2: He
428.4: is
428.6: making
428.8: his
429.0: first
429.2: mistake.

429.6: It
429.6: is
429.9: not
430.1: a
430.1: mistake.

432.8: They
433.1: do
433.1: not
433.3: make
433.4: mistakes.

434.7: They
434.9: do
435.1: not
435.2: do
435.4: random.

436.3: There
436.5: is
436.8: always
437.1: an
437.3: objective.
437.6: Always
438.0: a
438.0: target.

438.3: The
438.5: objectives
438.7: and
438.9: targets
439.1: always
439.3: came
439.5: from
439.7: us.

440.1: Who
440.3: is
440.5: giving
440.7: them
440.9: to
441.1: him
441.3: now?

441.7: Scary
442.2: version?

444.7: He
445.1: is.

504.8: I
505.0: emptied
505.2: it.

507.7: It
508.1: felt
508.5: a
508.5: little
508.7: light.

509.2: Put
509.4: it
509.6: down.

516.5: Front.

518.9: Sorry.
519.5: Old
519.9: habits.

523.2: Use
523.7: your
523.8: teeth.

537.1: Word
537.4: in
537.8: the
537.9: Ether
538.1: was
538.2: you
538.4: would
538.6: lost
538.9: your
539.0: memory.

540.2: You
540.6: still
540.8: should
541.0: have
541.1: moved.

544.9: What
545.4: do
545.5: you
545.6: want?

546.5: Conklin.

547.8: He
547.8: is
548.4: dead.
549.0: Shot
549.6: dead
550.2: in
550.3: Paris.

550.7: Dead
551.1: the
551.3: night
551.5: you
551.7: walked
552.0: out.

552.4: So
552.4: who
552.4: is
552.9: running
553.2: Treadstone
553.6: now?

554.8: Nobody.
555.6: They
556.4: shut
556.7: it
556.8: down.

557.8: It
558.6: is
559.4: over.
560.2: We
560.2: are
560.6: the
560.8: last
561.0: two.

567.2: If
567.4: it
567.6: is
567.7: over,
567.9: then
568.1: why
568.2: are
568.3: they
568.4: still
568.6: after
568.8: me?

568.7: I
569.2: do
569.2: not
569.6: know.

569.8: Ever
570.4: heard
570.6: the
570.6: name
570.7: Pamela
571.1: Landy?

571.4: I
571.9: do
571.9: not
572.1: know
572.3: who
572.5: that
572.5: is.

572.7: Pamela
572.9: Landy
573.2: in
573.4: Berlin.
573.7: What
574.0: is
574.3: going
574.6: on
574.8: in
575.0: Berlin?

574.9: I
575.4: do
575.4: not
576.5: know.

578.2: Why
578.6: would
578.8: I
578.9: lie?
