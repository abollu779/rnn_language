51.0: girls.

51.7: I

54.8: The

77.7: Did
77.9: not

88.1: Mrs.

89.9: If

90.4: could.

92.5: My
92.7: application
92.9: for
93.1: supervisor,
93.3: ma'am.

95.0: Was
95.4: just
95.5: wondering
95.6: if
95.7: they
95.9: are
96.0: still
96.2: considering
96.7: me
96.9: for
96.9: that
97.1: position.

98.2: Yes.

99.5: Well,
100.0: the
100.2: official
100.6: word
100.9: no.

102.1: They
102.1: are
102.5: not
102.8: assignin'
103.1: a
103.2: permanent
103.7: supervisor
104.2: for
104.4: the
104.5: Colored
104.7: Group.

105.6: May
106.0: I
106.1: ask
106.3: why?

107.0: I
107.2: do
107.2: not
107.5: know
107.7: "why."

108.7: I
109.0: did
109.0: not
109.4: ask
109.6: "why."

110.1: We
110.5: need
110.8: a
110.9: Supervisor,
111.1: ma'am.

112.0: We
112.4: have
112.4: not
112.6: had
112.8: one
112.9: since
113.2: Ms.
113.5: Jansen
113.8: got
114.0: sick
114.1: It
114.3: has
114.6: been
114.7: almost
114.9: a
115.2: year.

115.3: Things
115.8: are
115.9: workin'
116.1: just
116.3: fine
116.6: as
116.8: is.

117.4: I
117.4: am
117.9: doing
118.4: the
118.5: work
118.7: of
119.4: a
119.6: Supervisor.

120.4: Well.
120.7: That
121.0: is
121.2: NASA,
121.4: for
121.6: ya.

123.8: Fast
124.0: with
124.3: rocket
124.5: ships.
124.7: Slow
124.9: with
125.1: advancement.

126.9: Get
127.3: those
127.6: trajectories
128.0: calcs
128.4: worked
128.7: out.

129.0: We
129.2: need
129.4: em
129.6: for
129.8: the
130.0: Redstone
130.2: test.

163.8: Mach
164.3: 1
164.3: tunnel
165.0: test,
165.2: T-1
165.4: minute.

179.7: No
179.9: shoe
180.1: is
180.3: worth
180.5: your
180.7: life

181.5: One..
181.7: One
181.9: moment!

217.7: Shut
218.1: it
218.2: down.

224.6: If
225.0: we
225.2: alter
225.5: the
225.7: exterior
226.5: from
226.8: smooth

227.5: to
227.7: corrugated,
227.9: the
228.1: capsule
228.3: might
228.5: have
228.7: more
228.9: stability,

232.1: But
232.5: the
232.6: friction,
233.2: it
233.3: is
233.5: under
233.9: during
234.1: reentry..

235.4: Most
235.9: shield
236.4: erosion
237.8: occurs

238.8: on
239.0: the
239.3: posterior
239.7: side
240.1: abutting
240.5: the
240.9: retro-boosters.

242.5: Conclusion?

246.7: The
246.8: area
247.0: closest
247.3: to
247.6: the
247.9: boosters
248.3: is
248.5: closest
248.7: to
248.9: the
249.1: heat.

250.6: Coupled
251.1: with
251.2: rising
251.5: temperatures
251.9: on
252.2: reentry,

253.0: the
253.1: contacts
253.3: soften.

255.7: We
256.1: could
256.3: consider
256.8: another
257.4: fastener
258.1: other
258.4: than
258.6: bolts.

261.4: Yes

263.7: Yes.

270.7: There
270.9: is
271.1: another
271.3: opening
271.5: in
271.7: the
271.9: Engineer
272.1: Training
272.3: Program.

274.5: Flat
275.0: head
275.2: rivets
275.6: would
275.9: reduce
276.3: wind
276.5: drag.

277.0: Mary!
277.7: A
278.2: person
278.7: with
279.0: an
279.3: engineer's
279.6: mind
280.0: should
280.3: be
280.4: an
280.5: engineer.

280.8: You
281.2: can
281.2: not
281.4: be
281.5: a
281.6: Computer
282.1: the
282.5: rest
282.7: of
282.8: your
283.0: life.

283.6: Mr.
284.0: Zielinski.

285.4: I
285.4: am
285.8: a
285.9: Negro
286.1: woman.

287.1: I
287.1: am
287.4: not
287.6: gonna
287.8: to
287.9: entertain
288.1: the
288.5: impossible

289.2: And
289.6: I
289.6: am
289.7: a
289.9: polish
290.3: Jew
290.6: whose
290.9: parents
291.3: died
291.5: in
291.6: a
291.8: Nazi
292.1: prison
292.5: camp.

292.8: Now
293.2: I
293.2: am
293.4: standing
293.7: beneath
294.3: a
294.5: space
294.7: ship,

295.8: that
296.0: is
296.2: going
296.4: to
296.6: carry
296.8: an
297.0: astronaut
297.2: to
297.4: the
297.6: stars.

299.1: I
299.4: think
299.6: we
299.8: can
299.9: say,
300.4: we
301.0: are
301.1: living
301.3: the
301.5: impossible.

303.4: Let
303.8: me
303.9: ask
304.1: you..

304.8: If
305.2: you
305.4: were
305.6: a
305.8: white
306.0: male,

306.9: Would
307.3: you
307.5: wish
307.7: to
307.8: be
308.0: an
308.1: engineer?

309.5: I
309.7: would
309.9: not
310.2: have
310.3: to.
310.5: I
310.8: would
311.1: already
311.4: be
311.7: one.

313.5: Skirts
314.1: must
314.3: be
314.4: worn
314.7: past
315.0: the
315.2: knee.

315.2: Sweaters
316.1: are
316.2: preferred
316.4: to
316.6: blouses.

317.7: No
317.9: jewelry.

318.8: A
318.8: simple
319.3: pearl
319.5: necklace
319.7: is
320.0: the
320.1: exception.

321.3: Your
321.7: supervisor
322.4: is
322.7: Mr.
323.0: Al
323.3: Harrison.

324.2: Director
325.0: of
325.0: the
325.2: Space
325.5: Task
325.7: Group.

326.5: You
326.7: will
326.9: write
327.1: research,
327.5: proof
328.0: calculations,
328.2: so
328.4: forth.

329.8: Do
330.2: not
330.5: talk
330.7: to
330.9: Mr.
331.1: Harrison
331.4: lest
331.8: he
331.9: talks
332.1: to
332.3: you.

333.5: Not
333.9: many
334.1: Computers
334.6: last
334.8: more
335.0: than
335.1: a
335.2: few
335.3: days,

336.4: He
336.6: has
336.8: been
337.0: through
337.2: a
337.4: dozen
337.6: in
337.8: as
338.0: many
338.2: months.

339.1: Come
339.3: on,
339.5: keep
339.7: up

340.6: Things
341.1: move
341.3: fast
341.7: around
341.8: here

343.5: Your
343.7: clearance.

346.0: They
346.0: have
346.1: never
346.4: had
346.6: a
346.7: colored
347.0: in
347.1: here
347.2: before,
347.4: Katherine.

349.1: Do
349.3: not
349.5: embarrass
349.7: me.

376.4: This
376.7: was
376.8: not
376.9: emptied
377.1: last
377.4: night.

378.0: I
378.0: am
378.1: sorry.
378.3: I
378.5: am
378.7: not
378.8: the..

380.4: Custodian.

397.3: Excuse
397.8: me,
398.2: ma'am.
398.6: Mr.
399.0: Harrison's
399.5: Computer
399.7: reporting.

400.5: Take
400.7: the
401.0: desk
401.1: in
401.2: the
401.4: back.
401.5: I
401.5: will
401.7: get
401.9: your
402.1: work
402.3: in
402.5: a..

402.9: Bit.

406.7: Mr.
407.2: Harrison
407.2: will
407.5: not
407.8: warm
408.0: up
408.1: to
408.3: you,
408.4: do
408.5: not
408.6: expect
408.9: it.

410.1: Do
410.2: your
410.4: work,
410.6: keep
410.7: your
410.9: head
411.1: down.

412.3: Thank
412.8: you.

413.8: Go
414.1: on.
414.2: Get
414.4: settled.

426.9: Paul,

428.5: Why
428.7: are
428.9: we
429.1: still
429.2: losing
429.6: shingles
429.8: off
430.0: the
430.2: heat
430.4: shield?

431.6: Well,
431.8: We
432.0: are
432.2: working
432.4: with
432.6: a
432.8: prototype
433.0: of
433.2: the
433.4: capsule,
433.6: Al.

434.2: It
434.5: is
434.5: little
434.5: as
434.6: one
434.9: third
435.1: the
435.3: size..
435.6: I
436.0: get
436.2: that.
436.4: So..

437.7: What
437.8: do
438.0: you
438.1: do
438.3: with
438.4: our
438.6: million
438.7: dollar
438.9: fan,
439.1: Karl?

440.8: Turn
441.2: it
441.3: down?
441.8: No,
442.4: I
442.6: do
442.8: not
443.0: think...

442.8: Hey!
442.8: That
442.8: was
442.8: a
444.0: joke.

446.3: Paul,
446.4: if
446.6: the
446.7: heat
446.8: shield
447.0: comes
447.4: off

448.2: what
448.3: d'you
448.5: think
448.7: happens
448.9: to
449.1: our
449.3: astronaut?

449.6: I
449.9: know.

450.8: So
451.0: we
451.2: are
451.4: gonna..

452.6: We
452.7: are
452.8: gonna
452.9: come
453.0: up
453.1: with
453.3: a
453.5: solve,
453.7: right?

454.0: Yes,
454.5: sir.
454.6: We
454.6: are
454.9: working
455.2: on
455.3: it.

456.1: Ruth,
456.2: what
456.3: is
456.5: the
456.6: status
457.0: on
457.1: that
457.2: Computer?

457.8: She
458.0: is
458.2: right
458.4: behind
458.6: you,
458.8: Mr.
459.0: Harrison.

465.0: Does
465.1: she
465.3: handle
465.6: Analytic
466.0: Geometry?

467.4: Absolutely.
468.4: And
469.0: she
469.2: speaks.

470.5: Yes,
471.0: sir.
471.2: I
471.3: do.

472.8: Which
473.2: one?
473.4: Both.

474.6: Geometry
474.8: and
475.0: speaking.

478.1: Ruth.
478.3: Give
479.2: me
479.4: that.

483.6: Do
483.7: you
483.8: think
484.0: you..

485.7: You
485.8: think
486.0: you
486.2: can
486.3: find
486.5: me
486.6: the
486.8: Frenet
487.1: frame
487.4: for
487.5: this
487.6: data,

488.4: Using
488.8: the
489.0: GramSchmidt...

489.4: With
489.8: Orthogonalization
490.3: algorithm.
490.5: Yes,
490.7: sir.

491.8: I
492.1: prefer
492.4: it
492.7: over
492.7: Euclidean
492.9: coordinates.

535.9: think
536.0: that
536.1: is
536.1: a
536.2: pretty
536.3: reason
536.5: we
536.6: are

540.6: it
540.7: is
540.9: never
541.1: been
541.3: done
541.4: before.

543.6: And
543.6: because
543.9: it
544.2: is
544.4: never
544.5: been
544.7: done.
544.8: Everything
545.4: we
545.6: do

545.7: between
546.0: now
546.2: and
546.3: then
546.4: is
546.5: going

549.3: is
549.5: going
549.7: to
549.9: matter
550.1: to
550.3: their
550.5: wives.

552.0: To

554.5: to
554.7: matter
554.8: to
