16.8: best
17.1: school
17.3: for
17.6: Negros
18.0: in
18.1: the

19.5: It
19.6: is
19.7: the
19.9: only
20.1: school,
20.4: past
20.7: the
21.0: eighth

30.7: Trapezoid

32.5: Katherine's
33.2: in
33.3: the
33.4: sixth
33.8: grade.

33.9: They
34.7: want
34.9: to
35.0: take
35.2: her
35.4: early.

36.2: Tetrahedron,

38.8: Dodecahedron

40.4: They
40.6: are
40.8: offering
41.0: a
41.2: full
41.4: scholarship.

42.3: All
42.7: you
42.9: have
43.0: to
43.1: do
43.3: is
43.4: get
43.6: there.

45.6: Ms.
46.0: Coleman.

47.7: Why
48.1: do
48.1: not
48.3: you
48.4: solve
48.8: the
49.3: equation
49.9: on
50.0: the
50.1: board?

57.7: We
58.1: took
58.2: up
58.5: a
58.6: collection
58.9: amongst
59.2: the
59.5: teachers
59.8: and
59.9: such,

60.5: It
60.8: is
61.2: not
61.4: a
61.6: lot.

62.2: But
62.4: it
62.6: is
62.8: enough
63.0: to
63.2: help
63.4: get
63.6: you
63.8: settle
64.0: down

65.2: That
65.4: is
65.6: more
65.8: than
66.0: kind,
66.2: Ms.
66.4: Sumner.

79.2: If
79.6: the
79.7: product
80.1: of
80.3: two
80.5: terms
80.7: is
80.9: zero,

82.1: then
82.1: common
82.5: sense
82.7: says
83.0: at
83.2: least
83.3: one
83.6: of
83.7: the
83.8: two
84.0: terms

84.1: has
84.3: to
84.5: be
84.7: zero
84.9: to
85.1: start
85.3: with

86.3: So,
86.7: if
86.8: you
86.9: move
87.1: all
87.3: the
87.4: terms
87.8: over
88.0: to
88.2: one
88.4: side,

89.2: you
89.4: would
89.6: put
89.8: the
90.1: quadratics
90.8: into
91.0: a
91.1: form
91.4: that
91.5: can
91.6: be
91.7: factored,

92.9: Allowing
93.6: that
93.7: side
93.8: of
93.9: the
94.0: equation
94.4: to
94.7: equal
94.8: zero.

96.5: Once
97.0: you
97.0: have
97.1: done
97.4: that,
97.4: it
97.5: is
97.7: pretty
97.8: straight
98.0: forward
98.2: from
98.6: there

102.1: In
102.6: all
102.7: my
102.9: years
103.0: of
103.2: teaching,

104.6: I
104.6: have
105.0: never
105.2: seen
105.5: a
105.7: mind
106.0: like
106.1: the
106.2: one
106.4: your
106.5: daughter
106.8: has.

108.3: Katherine!
108.5: Hurry
108.7: on
108.9: now,
109.1: love

112.0: You
112.2: have

112.6: go.

114.1: Let
114.5: Mommy
114.7: take
114.9: you
115.1: in.

122.4: You
122.7: have
122.9: to
123.1: see
123.2: what
123.4: she
123.6: becomes.

151.0: Ok,

164.9: I

166.7: times.

169.1: Here
169.3: it
169.5: goes.

172.8: Yeah,
173.5: it
174.2: is

483.5: Engineer,
483.7: Mr.
483.9: Webb.

484.6: I
484.8: think
485.0: what
485.2: he
485.4: meant
485.6: to
485.8: say
486.0: is
486.2: that
486.4: speculation,
486.6: at
486.8: least

487.1: on
487.4: our
487.6: side
487.8: of
487.9: the
488.0: equation
488.4: by
488.7: definition,
489.1: can
489.5: be..

490.6: Just
491.0: a
491.0: little
491.1: dangerous.

492.3: Dangerous?

493.7: You
494.1: know
494.1: what
494.2: is
494.4: dangerous,
494.6: Mr.
494.8: Stafford?

496.1: Inaction,
497.0: and
497.3: indecision.

498.7: Russians
499.5: have
500.0: a
500.1: spy
500.3: satellite
500.5: lapping
500.7: the
500.9: planet,

502.1: taking
502.4: pictures
502.7: of
503.0: God
503.2: knows
503.7: what!

505.5: The
505.8: President
506.4: is
506.6: demanding
507.1: an
507.2: immediate
507.3: response.

507.7: No
508.2: more
508.4: delays.
508.7: Alan
509.1: Shepard,
509.4: John
509.6: Glenn,
509.9: your
510.0: uncle
510.2: Bob.

510.4: Does
510.4: not
510.6: matter,
510.7: just
510.9: get
511.1: us
511.2: up
511.3: there,
511.4: Harrison

512.2: We
512.6: can
512.6: not
512.9: justify
513.3: a
513.4: space
513.6: program

514.5: that
514.8: does
514.8: not
515.1: put
515.3: anything
515.5: in
515.7: space.

518.7: How
518.8: did
518.9: that
519.0: feel
519.1: in
519.3: there,
519.6: Paul?

520.7: Do
520.8: you
521.0: think
521.1: you
521.3: enlightened
521.5: the
521.7: Administrator?

524.9: No,
525.3: he
525.5: did
525.5: not
525.7: look
525.9: enlightened
526.1: to
526.3: me.

527.5: He
527.7: look
527.9: enlightened
528.0: to
528.3: you,
528.5: Sam?
528.8: Not
529.5: particularly.

530.6: And
531.0: just
531.1: so
531.2: you
531.3: know,
531.3: he
531.4: is
531.9: not
532.0: wrong
532.2: about
532.4: what
532.5: he
532.7: said
532.9: in
533.0: there.

533.0: You
533.3: know
533.4: that,
533.6: right?

534.8: Because
535.2: now
535.4: that
535.5: they
535.7: can
536.0: get
536.1: up
536.3: there,
536.4: a
536.6: bomb
536.9: will
537.1: follow.

538.4: That
538.4: is
538.5: what
538.9: happens
539.0: to
539.2: all
539.4: our
539.5: good
539.8: ideas.

541.3: I
541.5: imagine
541.7: there
541.9: is
542.1: too

543.3: Where
543.5: is
544.1: the
544.3: machine?

544.4: Any
545.2: day
545.3: now,
545.5: Mr.
545.7: Harrison.

546.3: Any
546.7: day
546.9: now.
547.1: Yes,
547.3: sir.

548.3: What
548.5: is
548.7: it
548.9: called?

550.1: The
550.3: initials...
550.5: The
550.7: IBM.

551.9: International
552.8: business
553.0: machine.

553.9: Space
554.6: is
554.7: a
554.8: business

556.7: I
557.0: need
557.2: a
557.3: mathematician.

558.3: I
558.3: will
558.7: put
558.9: in
559.1: another
559.3: request,
559.6: sir.
559.8: Another
560.0: request.

560.7: Jesus
561.3: Christ!
561.6: We
561.6: do
561.6: not
561.7: have
561.8: a
561.9: single
562.2: person,
562.7: in
562.7: this
562.9: entire
563.0: building,

563.8: that
564.0: can
564.2: handle
564.4: Analytic
565.0: Geometry?

565.7: That
565.8: is
566.3: what
566.4: I
566.4: have
566.5: been
566.5: told.

567.4: Well,
567.6: tell
567.8: me
568.0: something
568.2: else,
568.4: Ruth.
568.6: Like
568.8: we
569.0: are
569.2: going
569.4: to
569.6: find
569.8: such
570.0: a
570.2: person

570.1: before
570.2: the
570.4: Russians
570.6: plant
570.8: a
571.1: flag
571.3: on
571.5: the
571.7: damn
571.9: moon.

588.7: Ladies,
588.9: ladies

590.2: If
590.3: you
590.4: are
590.6: tardy,
590.8: you
591.0: do
591.0: not
591.1: get
591.4: an
591.4: assignment

591.9: if
591.9: you
592.0: do
592.1: not
592.2: get
592.3: an
592.4: assignment
592.5: you
592.7: do
592.9: not
593.1: have
593.2: a
593.2: job.
