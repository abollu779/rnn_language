1.5: You
1.8: took
2.0: that
2.3: book,
2.5: mamma?

3.4: Son,
3.7: I
4.1: pay
4.2: taxes.

5.5: And
5.6: taxes
5.8: pay
6.1: for
6.3: everything
6.6: in
6.9: that
7.1: library.

7.5: You
7.7: can
7.9: not
8.1: take
8.3: something
8.5: you
8.7: have
8.9: already
9.1: paid
9.3: for.

14.4: FORTRAN
15.3: is
15.6: a
15.7: new
16.0: and
16.3: exciting
16.5: language..

18.0: Used
18.5: by
19.0: programmers
19.5: to
19.6: communicate
19.9: with
20.1: computers...

21.5: It
21.8: is
22.2: exciting,
22.5: as
22.8: it
23.1: is
23.5: the
23.8: way
24.2: of
24.4: the
24.6: future.

25.8: And
26.0: everybody
26.9: smile.

27.0: Everybody
28.1: smile.

32.4: Make
32.9: a
33.0: wish!

37.9: Leonard,
38.3: you
38.7: need
38.8: to
39.0: get
39.1: you
39.2: a
39.3: job
39.5: now.

40.2: Two
40.4: girls!

45.0: Well,
45.5: look
46.0: at
46.6: that.
46.8: Look
47.0: at
47.2: what?

47.4: What
47.7: a
48.2: surprise.

51.7: I
51.7: will
52.2: say.

53.6: Howard
54.3: must
54.5: have
54.6: invited
54.9: him.
55.1: Mmm.
55.3: Hmmm.

55.9: Let
56.2: me
56.4: go
56.7: help
56.9: him
57.1: with
57.2: those
57.4: flowers

93.4: I
93.9: believe
94.1: I
94.4: owe
94.5: you
94.7: an
94.8: apology.

98.1: Well,
98.3: is
98.5: that
98.7: it?

100.7: Can
101.0: I
101.3: make
101.5: it
101.7: while
101.9: we
102.2: dance?

114.7: I
114.8: am
115.1: afraid
115.3: I
115.5: simply
115.9: misspoke
116.1: the
116.4: other
116.6: day,
116.7: Mrs.
116.9: Goble.

119.8: I
119.9: have
120.0: been
120.4: away
120.5: for
120.7: a
120.8: long
121.0: time.

122.8: I
122.8: imagine,
123.0: I
123.2: am
123.4: just
123.6: out
123.8: of
124.0: practice.

126.4: Mm-hmm.

127.7: Yeah.
127.8: I
128.6: was
128.8: hoping
129.1: you
129.1: would
129.6: allow
129.8: me
129.9: to
130.1: start
130.3: over?

132.3: Mm-hmm.

133.4: So,
133.7: the
134.0: thing
134.3: is..

135.6: I
135.7: have
135.8: an
136.1: interest
136.4: in
136.6: getting
136.7: to
136.9: know
136.9: you
137.1: better.

138.3: Mm-hmm.

141.2: You
141.4: are
141.6: one
141.8: tough
142.1: customer.
142.3: Huh?

145.3: You
145.8: have
145.8: not
146.0: said
146.1: you
146.3: are
146.4: sorry
146.6: yet

146.9: Right.
147.1: Of
147.3: course.

153.5: I
153.7: am
154.0: sorry,
154.2: Katherine.

155.9: For
155.9: what,
156.1: Jim?

158.1: Underestimating
158.3: you.

160.3: And
160.6: any
161.0: other
161.4: woman
161.5: like
161.9: you.

164.5: Though
164.9: I
165.1: do
165.1: not
165.2: imagine
165.4: there
165.7: is
166.0: many.

168.7: That
168.9: is
169.2: good
169.4: practice,
169.6: right
170.1: there.

173.5: We
173.6: interrupt
174.5: this
174.6: musical
174.8: programming
175.0: with
175.2: breaking
175.4: news.

177.6: The
178.0: Soviet
178.4: news
178.7: agency
179.0: has
179.5: announced
179.7: that
179.9: Russian
180.1: cosmonaut,

180.7: Yuri
181.5: Gagarin,
181.6: has
182.4: become
182.7: the
182.9: first
183.3: man
183.5: in
183.8: space.

184.4: Gagarin
185.0: completed
185.6: one
185.9: full
186.0: orbit
186.3: around
186.6: the
186.8: planet
187.1: in
187.5: 108
187.7: minutes.

188.6: Stay
189.4: tuned
189.6: to
189.7: the
189.9: station
189.9: for
190.4: more
190.5: details,
191.2: as
191.5: they
191.5: become
191.7: available.

192.3: Well,
193.0: I
193.8: guess
194.2: that
194.4: puts
194.6: us
194.9: behind
195.0: the
195.3: curve.

195.9: The
196.1: Vostok
196.3: 1
196.5: rocket,
196.7: delivered
196.9: Russian
197.1: cosmonaut

198.4: Yuri
199.2: Gagarin,
199.4: 3KA
199.6: capsule
199.8: into
200.0: orbit
200.2: at
200.4: 6:07
200.6: UTC.

203.6: Reentering
204.4: Russian
204.7: Air
205.0: Space
205.3: at
205.6: 7:55
206.7: UTC.
206.9: Proving
207.1: conclusively

208.6: that
208.8: man
209.0: could
209.2: survive
209.4: orbital
209.6: space
209.8: flight
210.0: Gagarin
210.2: was
210.4: awarded
210.6: the
210.8: Order
211.0: of
211.2: Lenin

213.5: Well..

214.5: They
214.5: beat
214.6: the
214.7: pants
214.9: off
215.1: us.
215.3: Let's
215.5: go..

217.9: Just
218.1: learn
218.3: how
218.5: to
218.7: fly
218.9: to
219.1: space.

221.9: And
222.1: has
222.6: been
222.9: proclaimed
223.2: a
223.6: national
223.8: hero.

225.1: This
225.6: is
225.9: a
226.0: day
226.2: of
226.4: unprecedented
227.1: triumph
228.1: for
228.2: the
228.3: Russian
228.7: space
229.0: program,

229.9: And
229.9: a
230.0: crushing
231.2: blow
231.4: for
231.6: America
231.8: in
232.0: the
232.2: race
232.4: for
232.6: space.

234.1: I
234.4: want
234.6: to
234.6: thank
234.7: everyone
234.9: for
235.1: staying.

237.0: I
237.2: know
237.4: it
237.6: is
237.8: late,
238.0: and
238.2: after
238.4: what
238.6: we
238.8: just
239.0: saw

239.7: I
239.7: am
240.0: sure
240.2: everyone's
240.7: probably
240.9: anxious
241.3: to
241.8: go
241.9: home.

242.7: But
242.8: before
243.3: we
243.4: do,
243.5: I
243.7: just
243.8: have
244.0: to
244.1: ask
244.2: the
244.4: question

246.4: The
246.7: same
247.3: one

248.7: I
248.7: have
249.1: been
249.2: asking
249.5: myself
249.6: all
250.1: the
250.2: way
250.2: over
250.5: here,
250.6: which
250.8: is

253.6: How
253.9: the
254.1: hell
254.2: did
254.4: we
254.4: find
254.8: ourselves
255.0: in
255.3: second
255.7: place
255.9: in
256.1: a
256.2: two
256.3: men
256.5: race?

258.0: Anybody?

260.0: Paul?

262.4: I
262.7: think
263.0: Glenn
263.1: said
263.3: it
263.5: pretty
263.7: well.
263.9: They
264.1: are
264.3: just
264.5: outworking
264.7: us.

264.9: And
265.1: the
265.3: reason
265.5: I
265.7: have
265.9: to..

267.1: Think
267.4: that
267.8: is
267.9: because
268.1: I
268.3: refuse
268.6: to
268.7: believe
268.8: that
269.0: the
269.2: Russians
269.6: are
269.6: smarter
269.8: than
270.0: us,

270.1: or
270.3: that
270.6: they
270.9: have
271.2: more
271.6: technology.
271.8: Or
272.1: that
272.4: they
272.7: care
272.9: more.

275.2: But
275.6: I
275.6: do
275.6: not
275.7: know?
275.9: Is
276.0: that
276.0: possible?

278.1: Is
278.1: it
278.2: possible
279.2: that
279.2: it
279.2: actually
279.7: means
280.2: more
280.4: to
280.6: them?

282.5: We
282.7: are
282.9: in
283.2: the
283.2: fight
283.6: of
283.7: our
283.8: lives,
284.2: people.

285.3: Not
285.4: on
285.5: some
286.1: epic
286.3: joyride!

288.5: I
288.8: just
289.0: saw
289.2: seven
289.4: faces

290.4: who
290.5: were
290.5: not
291.1: sure
291.3: that
291.5: we
291.6: can
291.7: get
291.9: there.

296.8: This
297.2: is
297.3: our
297.4: problem.

299.2: And
299.4: so,
299.9: as
300.0: of
300.1: right
300.4: now,

302.9: There
303.0: is
303.4: only
303.5: two
303.7: things
303.8: you
304.1: need
304.1: to
304.3: know
304.4: going
304.6: forward

305.2: One
305.3: is,
305.5: staying
305.8: here
306.1: working
306.3: late
306.5: that
306.7: is
306.9: gonna
307.1: be
307.2: a
307.2: fact
307.6: of
307.6: life.

309.1: And
309.2: two,
309.7: do
309.7: not
309.9: expect
310.2: your
310.4: paychecks
310.9: reflect
311.0: the
311.2: extra
311.4: time

311.4: it
311.8: is
311.9: gonna
312.1: take
312.1: to
312.4: catch
312.7: up
312.8: and
312.9: pass
313.0: those
313.2: bastards.

316.2: For
316.6: those
316.8: of
316.9: you
317.0: that
317.1: can
317.1: not
317.4: work
317.5: that
317.7: way,
317.9: I
318.1: understand
318.3: 'em

318.5: thank
318.7: you
318.9: for
319.0: what
319.1: you
319.2: have
319.4: done.

321.2: For
321.2: everyone
322.0: else,

323.6: I
324.0: suggest
324.4: you
324.4: call
324.7: your
324.9: wives..

325.8: And
326.1: tell
326.4: them
326.7: how
326.7: it
326.8: is
326.9: gonna
327.1: be.

327.7: I
327.7: will
327.9: start
328.6: with
328.8: mine.

386.9: Sam,
387.1: keep
387.3: it
387.5: up
387.7: Yes,
387.9: sir

409.0: End
409.7: of
409.8: the
409.9: day.

416.5: Okay.
416.6: We
416.6: are
417.0: looking
417.5: good...

422.6: Try!

434.6: Sir!
434.6: It
434.6: might
434.6: be
434.6: the
434.7: selector
435.1: latch!
435.5: I
435.9: am
436.3: taking
436.5: a
436.7: walk!

437.4: We
437.6: are
438.0: honored
438.3: to
438.4: serve
438.6: our
438.8: country.
439.0: So,
439.2: we
439.4: do
439.6: not
439.8: think
440.0: about..

440.6: Danger.
440.8: No
441.0: time
441.2: to
441.4: be
441.6: scared.

443.7: We
444.0: got
444.2: a
444.4: job
444.6: to
444.8: do

454.3: Mrs.
454.9: Jackson!

456.7: Colored
457.2: seats
457.5: are
457.6: at
457.7: the
457.8: back
458.1: of
458.1: the
458.2: courtroom.

459.0: Thank
459.6: you,
459.6: ma'am.

479.6: So,
479.9: which
480.2: one
480.3: of
480.4: you
480.5: wants
480.6: to
480.7: go
480.7: first?

504.8: The
505.2: IBM
506.1: 7090
507.0: Data
508.2: Processing
508.4: System,

509.4: It
509.8: has
509.9: a
510.1: capability
510.5: of
510.9: solving
511.3: of
511.7: over
511.9: 24,000
512.1: multiplications

516.3: per
516.7: second!

517.0: Holy
517.7: Moses,
517.9: that
518.2: is
518.5: lightning
518.8: fast
519.0: They
519.2: will
519.5: never
519.8: get
519.9: that
520.0: to
520.2: work.

521.4: It
521.5: will
522.0: run
522.3: eventually.
522.8: And
523.0: when
523.1: it
523.2: does
523.4: we
523.7: have
523.7: to
523.8: know
524.1: how
524.1: to
524.2: program
524.4: it.

524.9: Unless
525.4: you
525.4: would
525.5: rather
525.6: be
525.9: out
526.0: of
526.0: a
526.1: job?
526.3: No!

533.8: Mr.
534.0: Z.

536.0: I
536.3: got
536.5: a
536.6: court
536.9: date.

541.9: Computer
542.6: uses
543.1: it
543.6: as
543.8: its
544.0: high
544.2: speed
544.4: storage
544.6: unit

544.7: An
545.3: information
545.9: holding
546.1: device.

548.8: So
549.3: you
549.4: have
549.5: a
549.6: brain

550.4: That,
550.8: I
550.9: can
551.1: work
551.2: with

555.2: that
555.6: is
556.0: in
556.1: the
556.2: wrong
556.6: spot

562.3: That
562.9: a
563.0: girl!

566.8: Ruth!
567.0: Yes,
567.2: sir.

568.1: Get
568.3: the
568.5: Cape
568.7: on
568.9: the
569.1: line.
569.3: Shepard's
569.5: trajectories
569.7: need
569.9: to
570.1: be
570.3: updated.

576.7: Where
577.2: is
577.4: she?
