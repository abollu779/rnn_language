0.3: Do
0.5: not
0.7: make
0.9: me
1.1: mad
1.3: again.
1.5: Yes,
1.7: ma'am.

7.4: And
7.5: do
7.6: not
7.8: make
8.2: me
8.4: late
8.6: either.

9.8: You
9.8: do
9.9: not
10.0: really
10.1: want
10.3: me
10.3: to
10.5: make
10.7: you?

19.6: Hi,
19.8: gentlemen.
20.2: Tonight
20.9: we
21.2: discuss
21.7: PlanckEinstein.

22.8: Wavelength
23.9: relationships..

28.9: Yes?

31.8: I
32.0: am
32.2: Mary
32.4: Jackson.
32.6: I
32.8: am
33.0: enrolled.

36.6: Well.
36.9: The
37.2: curriculum
38.0: is
38.1: not
38.1: designed
38.6: for
38.7: teaching...
38.9: a
39.1: woman.

40.4: Well,
40.9: I
41.0: imagine
41.2: it
41.4: is
41.5: the
41.6: same
41.9: as
41.9: teaching
42.1: a
42.3: man.

44.4: I
44.6: do
44.6: not
44.8: see
45.0: a
45.0: colored
45.4: section.
45.9: Should
46.4: I
46.9: just
47.1: take
47.2: any
47.4: seat?

53.6: Thank
54.1: you.

59.9: OK.

62.4: PlanckEinstein...

65.3: The
65.6: problem
66.2: is
66.9: when
67.0: the
67.2: capsule
67.7: moves
68.1: from
68.3: an
68.5: elliptical
68.9: orbit
69.4: to
69.7: a
69.8: parabolic
70.0: orbit.

71.8: There
72.0: is
72.2: no
72.4: mathematical
72.6: formula
72.8: for
73.0: that.

74.4: As
74.8: we
74.9: can
75.0: calculate
75.2: launch,
75.4: landing

77.1: but
77.3: without
77.5: this
77.7: conversion,
78.2: the
78.6: capsule
79.1: stays
79.4: in
79.5: orbit,
79.7: we
79.9: can
79.9: not
80.1: bring
80.2: it
80.3: back
80.4: home.

83.2: Maybe
83.7: we
83.7: have
83.8: been
83.8: thinking
84.1: about
84.4: this
84.6: all
84.7: wrong.

85.4: How's
85.9: that?

91.0: Maybe
91.2: it
91.5: is
91.6: not
91.7: new
91.9: math
92.1: at
92.2: all.

94.7: It
95.2: could
95.4: be
95.5: old
95.9: math.

97.5: Something
98.0: that
98.1: looks
98.3: at
98.5: the
98.6: problem
99.0: numerically,
99.3: and
99.8: not
100.0: theoretically

101.5: Math
102.1: is
102.7: always
103.3: dependable.
103.9: For
104.6: you
104.8: it
105.0: is.

112.1: Euler's
112.8: Method.

113.4: Euler's
114.0: Method?
114.2: Yes.

115.3: That
115.4: is
116.1: ancient.
116.5: But
117.5: it
117.6: works!

118.6: It
119.0: works
119.2: numerically.

156.5: That
156.5: is
157.0: it!

160.1: Let's
160.1: type
160.6: it
160.7: up.

187.8: Dorothy.

189.8: Mrs.
190.0: Mitchell.

197.3: You
197.5: are
197.7: working
198.1: late
198.2: today?

200.3: Seems
200.9: always
201.2: happened
201.5: that
201.5: way

202.6: Yes.
203.3: Seems
204.1: to.

213.0: Thank
213.5: you.

217.6: I
217.9: hear
218.1: the
218.3: IBM
218.5: is
218.7: at
218.9: full
219.6: capacity.

221.6: You
221.8: certainly
222.0: have
222.2: a
222.4: knack
222.6: for
222.8: it

223.8: My
224.2: father
224.6: taught
224.7: me
224.9: a
225.0: thing
225.0: or
225.3: two
225.3: about
225.5: mechanics.

227.7: You
227.9: know,
228.1: I
228.3: have
228.5: a
228.7: few
228.9: girls
229.1: in
229.3: the
229.5: East
229.7: Group
229.9: that
230.1: have
230.3: an
230.5: interest
230.7: in
230.9: learnin'
231.1: more
231.3: about
231.5: it.

232.0: It
232.2: is
232.4: the
232.7: future.
233.2: I
233.8: may
233.9: bring
234.0: em
234.2: by,
234.3: if
234.5: it
234.6: is
234.8: all
234.9: the
235.1: same
235.2: to
235.3: you.

237.1: That
237.3: is
237.5: not
237.7: my
237.9: decision.
238.1: Ma'am.
238.3: That
238.5: would
238.7: be
238.9: the
239.1: supervisor's.

241.8: Yes.
242.1: That
242.4: is
242.7: true.

244.6: Well.
244.8: Good
245.0: night,
245.2: Mrs.
245.4: Mitchell.

249.3: You
249.5: know,
249.7: Dorothy...

252.5: Despite
252.7: what
252.9: you
253.1: may
253.3: think..
253.5: I
253.7: have
253.9: nothin'
254.1: against
254.3: ya'll.

258.1: I
258.7: know.
259.4: I
260.1: know
260.8: you
261.0: probably
261.1: believe
261.9: that.

275.0: Goodnight,
275.2: Katherine.

277.3: Good
277.4: night!

281.4: Mamma.
281.6: Hey,
281.8: baby

283.4: Hi!
283.8: Hey!

287.4: Please
288.0: do
288.0: not
288.2: tell
288.4: me
288.5: I
288.6: miss
288.7: someone's
289.4: birthday

290.0: No,
290.2: you
290.4: did
290.6: not
290.8: No,
291.0: you
291.2: did,
291.4: not
291.6: mamma

291.5: Madame...
291.7: Your
291.9: seat.

293.7: Thank
294.8: you
295.9: Well,
297.1: is
297.4: it
297.5: my
297.7: birthday?

298.4: No,
298.6: mamma.

300.8: You
301.1: are
301.4: all
301.6: look
301.8: so
301.9: pretty

305.7: Mamma,
305.9: What
306.1: is
306.4: going
307.4: on?

310.8: Good
311.2: evening,
311.4: Katherine.

317.8: So,
318.0: you
318.2: are
318.4: not
318.6: gonna
318.8: say
319.0: anything?
319.2: It
319.4: is
319.6: not
319.8: my
320.0: place.

323.1: You,
323.3: really?

326.9: Okay,
327.6: I
327.6: am
327.7: not
327.8: going
327.9: to
328.0: do
328.1: this
328.3: all
328.5: night...

331.7: Oh,
331.9: mother
332.1: of
332.3: mercy.
332.5: That
332.7: is
332.9: for
333.1: me?

338.5: Are
338.9: you
339.0: sad,
339.2: Mamma?

339.9: No!
340.2: It
340.5: is
340.8: okay,
340.9: Mamma.
341.0: He
341.1: is
341.2: a
341.4: good
342.6: man.

343.3: I
343.5: know.
343.7: I
343.9: know.
344.1: I
344.3: just.
344.5: I
344.7: can
344.9: not
345.1: help
345.3: it.

346.2: He
346.7: has
346.7: not
347.1: even
347.4: asked
347.6: you
347.8: yet.

349.3: I
349.5: know,
349.7: but
349.9: he
350.1: is..
350.3: You
350.5: are,
350.7: right?

352.6: If
352.8: ya
353.0: will
353.2: let
353.4: me.

354.0: Go
354.2: on.
354.4: She
354.6: is
354.8: already
355.0: crying.

357.6: This
357.8: was
358.0: my
358.2: mother's
358.4: ring.
358.6: It
358.8: is
359.0: beautiful

361.6: She
361.8: and
362.1: my
362.2: father
362.4: were
362.7: married
362.9: for..
363.1: For
363.3: 52
364.3: years.

366.5: I
366.6: figure
366.7: it
366.8: is
367.0: about
367.1: as
367.2: lucky
367.3: as
367.5: a
367.6: ring
367.7: as
367.9: you
368.1: can
368.1: get.

370.4: The
370.6: day
370.8: I
371.0: met
371.2: you,
371.4: I
371.6: called
371.8: my
372.0: mother...

372.7: I
373.2: "Mom!
373.7: I
374.3: met
374.9: the
374.9: woman
375.1: I
375.3: want
375.5: to
375.7: marry."

375.8: What
375.8: would
376.2: she
376.3: say?

377.2: She
377.4: "She
377.6: must
377.8: be
378.0: something,
378.2: Jimmy.
378.4: Really
378.6: something."

379.8: Then
380.0: what
380.2: would
380.4: you
380.6: say?

381.0: I
381.5: "No,
382.1: She
382.7: is
383.2: more
383.8: than
384.4: Something,
384.6: She
384.8: is
385.0: Everything."

390.0: I
390.2: planned
390.5: on
390.5: this
390.7: being
390.8: more
391.2: romantic.
391.4: I
391.6: will
391.8: make
392.0: that
392.1: up
392.2: to
392.4: you
392.5: real
392.7: soon.

395.5: But
395.9: I
396.4: know
396.9: marrying
397.4: you..
397.9: Includes
398.1: me
398.4: and
398.7: the
399.0: girls
399.3: as
399.4: well.

401.6: Amen
402.3: to
402.5: that.

403.7: I
404.1: do.

405.9: I
406.0: did
406.1: not
406.3: ask
406.5: you
406.7: yet.
406.9: Hurry
407.1: up!

415.5: No
415.7: pain,
415.9: please!
416.1: No,
416.3: girls.
416.5: No
416.7: tears.

422.9: The
423.1: Mercury
423.3: Atlas
423.5: Space
423.7: vehicle,
423.9: which
424.1: will
424.3: putt
424.5: John
424.7: Glenn

425.9: the
426.2: first
426.5: American
426.7: into
426.9: Earth
427.1: orbit,

427.9: has
428.4: already
428.6: undergone
429.0: 5
429.5: unmanned
430.0: flight
430.5: tests.

431.2: NASA
431.4: has
431.6: confirmed
431.8: that
432.0: the
432.2: IBM
432.4: 790
432.6: data
432.8: processing

435.8: system
436.0: has
436.2: been
436.4: utilized
436.6: to
436.8: confirm
437.0: all
437.2: of
437.4: the
437.6: mission's
437.8: long
438.0: and
438.2: recovery
438.4: system
438.6: calculations.

439.9: The
440.1: modifications
440.3: and
440.5: equipment
440.7: installations
440.9: are
441.1: progressing
441.3: on
441.5: the
441.7: schedule.

444.4: Them,
444.7: Here

446.7: You
446.9: wanted
447.1: to
447.3: see
447.5: me,
447.7: sir?
447.9: Have
448.1: a
448.3: seat

449.9: Is
450.2: there
450.4: something
450.7: wrong,
450.9: Mr.
451.1: Harrison?

451.7: No.
451.9: There
452.1: is
452.4: nothing
452.6: wrong.

455.1: In
455.3: fact
455.5: our
455.7: IBM
455.9: is
456.1: churning
456.3: out
456.5: numbers
456.7: in
456.9: fractions
457.1: of
457.3: the
457.5: time
457.7: any
457.9: human
458.1: can

459.2: Present
459.8: company
460.0: included.

461.7: That
461.9: is
462.1: good
462.3: then.

466.0: Maybe.

468.0: The
468.1: thing
468.3: is,
468.5: the
468.7: Cape
468.9: is
469.1: now
469.2: insisting
469.5: on
469.8: doing
470.0: all
470.1: the
470.3: backups
470.8: down
471.0: there.
471.2: On
471.4: site.

473.2: I
473.6: see.

474.2: So,
474.6: we
474.8: will
474.8: not
474.9: be
475.0: running
475.3: backups
475.7: here.

477.6: And
477.8: truth
478.0: be
478.2: told,
478.4: we
478.6: can
478.8: not
479.0: keep
479.2: up
479.4: with
479.6: that
479.8: IBM
480.0: anyhow.

483.7: Long
484.1: story
484.5: short,
484.5: we
484.8: no
484.9: longer
485.0: need
485.4: a..
485.5: Computer
486.0: in
486.3: this
486.5: department.

488.7: Progress
489.3: is
489.5: a
489.6: double
489.9: edged
490.1: sword.

496.0: Let's
496.1: have
496.2: you
496.4: report
496.8: back
497.0: to
497.0: the
497.1: West
497.3: Group
497.6: for
497.8: now.

498.3: I
498.5: will
498.8: see
499.1: if
499.4: we
499.7: can
500.0: find
500.3: another
500.6: assignment.
500.9: Thank
501.4: you,
501.5: sir.

506.0: Katherine,
506.7: I'm..
507.4: I
508.2: am
508.9: sorry
509.7: about
510.0: this

512.2: It
512.4: is
512.6: out
512.8: of
513.0: my
513.2: hands,
513.4: if
513.6: you
513.8: can
514.0: believe
514.2: that.

515.2: I
515.4: understand.

540.5: Katherine..
543.1: We
543.5: heard
543.8: you
543.9: got
544.0: engaged.

545.3: Yes.
545.7: That
546.2: is
546.6: thoughtful
547.1: of
547.6: you.

555.3: They
555.3: are
555.7: lovely.
556.0: Mr.
557.4: Harrison's
557.5: idea
558.3: really.

559.3: Although
559.9: I
559.9: suspect
560.2: his
560.5: wife
560.8: did
561.0: the
561.1: picking
561.3: out.

562.5: I
562.7: can
562.9: not
563.1: imagine
563.3: he
563.5: has
563.7: an
563.9: eye
564.1: for
564.3: anything
