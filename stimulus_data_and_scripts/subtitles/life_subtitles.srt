ATTENBOROUGH: Our planet may be home to

1
00:00:24,287 --> 00:00:27,324
30 million different kinds
of animals and plants,

2
00:00:27,407 --> 00:00:32,197
each individual locked in
its own lifelong fight for survival.

3
00:00:33,527 --> 00:00:36,246
Everywhere you look,
on land or in the ocean,

4
00:00:36,327 --> 00:00:38,761
there are extraordinary examples
of the lengths

5
00:00:38,847 --> 00:00:41,964
living things go to to stay alive.

6
00:00:45,807 --> 00:00:48,924
This is the coast of Florida.

7
00:00:50,327 --> 00:00:53,160
Here, strange scars on the sea bed

8
00:00:53,247 --> 00:00:56,444
hint at one animal's
remarkable strategy.

9
00:01:02,087 --> 00:01:04,282
These are bottlenose dolphins,

10
00:01:04,367 --> 00:01:07,325
one of the most
intelligent animals on Earth.

11
00:01:08,327 --> 00:01:13,447
Their prey is very elusive,
fast-swimming fish.

12
00:01:14,567 --> 00:01:18,799
But the dolphins have invented
a completely new way of hunting.

13
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:27,235
By beating its tail down hard,
this dolphin stirs up the shallow silt.

14
00:01:34,047 --> 00:01:36,402
And by swimming in a tight circle,

15
00:01:36,487 --> 00:01:40,878
it creates a ring of mushrooming mud
around a shoal of fish.

16
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:04,958
The contracting ring traps the fish
just like a net.

17
00:02:05,047 --> 00:02:08,084
Panicked, the fish jump to escape,

18
00:02:08,967 --> 00:02:12,755
right into the open mouths
of the waiting dolphins.

19
00:02:25,007 --> 00:02:28,443
Again and again,
the lead dolphin creates a circle

20
00:02:28,527 --> 00:02:31,758
before they all line up
with perfect timing.

21
00:02:58,647 --> 00:03:00,603
These dolphins are the only ones

22
00:03:00,687 --> 00:03:03,406
known to have developed
this hunting behaviour,

23
00:03:03,487 --> 00:03:05,955
and it gives them an edge.

24
00:03:10,207 --> 00:03:11,765
This sort of advantage

25
00:03:11,847 --> 00:03:14,759
may mean the difference
between life and death

26
00:03:14,847 --> 00:03:17,315
in the survival of the fittest.

27
00:03:22,607 --> 00:03:28,159
This series reveals the most
spectacular and extraordinary strategies

28
00:03:28,247 --> 00:03:31,683
that animals and plants have developed
to stay alive.

29
00:04:06,847 --> 00:04:11,159
For every creature,
every day is full of challenges,

30
00:04:11,247 --> 00:04:16,480
all of which must be overcome,
somehow, in order to survive.

31
00:04:28,047 --> 00:04:33,599
Kenya, famous for its big cats,
the supreme hunters.

32
00:04:46,247 --> 00:04:50,001
Cheetahs specialise in hunting at speed.

33
00:04:50,087 --> 00:04:55,764
Though fast, they are fragile creatures,
built to sprint after small prey.

34
00:04:56,847 --> 00:04:59,042
They don't have the strength
or weight of a lion

35
00:04:59,127 --> 00:05:01,038
to bring down larger animals.

36
00:05:03,767 --> 00:05:06,918
This male is different.
He doesn't hunt alone.

37
00:05:07,007 --> 00:05:10,317
He's learnt that
there is strength in numbers.

38
00:05:24,007 --> 00:05:28,478
But here, there are not just two,
but three cheetahs.

39
00:05:29,127 --> 00:05:31,516
A band of brothers.

40
00:05:37,647 --> 00:05:39,478
They have changed their tactics

41
00:05:39,567 --> 00:05:43,560
and by doing so
have taken their prey by surprise.

42
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:47,043
They have learnt that working together,

43
00:05:47,127 --> 00:05:50,642
they can bring down large prey.

44
00:05:54,727 --> 00:05:56,558
An ostrich.

45
00:05:56,647 --> 00:06:01,004
A bird that towers over a cheetah
and is more than twice as heavy.

46
00:06:02,327 --> 00:06:07,321
It can't fly to escape danger,
but it can lash out with a deadly kick.

47
00:06:09,127 --> 00:06:12,642
A female, unaware as yet of any danger.

48
00:06:18,807 --> 00:06:22,117
Even with three of them,
this is still highly risky.

49
00:06:22,727 --> 00:06:23,842
If one gets injured,

50
00:06:23,927 --> 00:06:27,522
the other two couldn't hope
to tackle such large prey.

51
00:06:35,847 --> 00:06:37,200
On the other hand,

52
00:06:37,287 --> 00:06:41,246
if they get it right,
the rewards are huge.

(CAWING)

54
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:52,762
The male has spotted
one of the brothers, but only one.

55
00:06:53,487 --> 00:06:55,603
It's not too worried.

56
00:07:07,807 --> 00:07:10,082
Then suddenly, there are three!

(OSTRICH SCREECHING)

58
00:07:21,487 --> 00:07:23,842
The female is slower
to realise the danger,

59
00:07:23,927 --> 00:07:26,600
and the cheetahs switch targets.

60

(CHEETAHS GROWLING)

62
00:07:52,127 --> 00:07:56,166
It takes the combined effort
and weight of all three brothers

63
00:07:56,247 --> 00:07:58,442
to bring down this powerful bird.

64
00:07:58,527 --> 00:08:01,917
Even now, the ostrich
could land a fatal kick.

(CHEETAH BREATHING HEAVILY)

66
00:08:09,607 --> 00:08:11,757
So far, the brothers are winning.

67
00:08:11,847 --> 00:08:16,204
Ostriches have yet to
find a way to foil such tactics.

68
00:08:18,767 --> 00:08:22,123
Other animals have also evolved
surprising tactics

69
00:08:22,207 --> 00:08:25,404
to outmanoeuvre the enemy,
not with brute strength,

70
00:08:25,487 --> 00:08:28,047
but with extraordinary weapons.

71
00:08:29,807 --> 00:08:31,160
Madagascar.

72
00:08:32,567 --> 00:08:37,322
A strange world
where nothing is quite as it seems.

73
00:08:46,407 --> 00:08:50,685
To hunt here requires
stealth and subterfuge.

74
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:56,844
And living within the trees
is a master of ambush,

75
00:08:56,927 --> 00:08:59,077
a praying mantis.

76
00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:02,841
Well-camouflaged and lightning-quick,

77
00:09:02,927 --> 00:09:05,885
these insects are
highly efficient predators.

78
00:09:23,727 --> 00:09:26,560
But even they are outgunned.

79
00:09:33,487 --> 00:09:35,000
A chameleon.

80
00:09:36,487 --> 00:09:38,842
Its camouflage is exceptional

81
00:09:38,927 --> 00:09:42,886
because it can change its skin colour
to match its surroundings.

82
00:09:49,887 --> 00:09:53,800
Its eyes move independently
to spot prey.

83
00:09:58,847 --> 00:10:03,159
It creeps towards its victim
until just in range.

84
00:10:07,687 --> 00:10:11,475
Then it unleashes a super weapon.

85
00:10:11,567 --> 00:10:15,162
Its tongue shoots out at
1 5 metres per second

86
00:10:20,087 --> 00:10:24,319
and not only hits,
but grasps, its target.

87
00:10:40,447 --> 00:10:43,200
But few hunters are always successful.

88
00:10:43,287 --> 00:10:46,484
For them, a hunt is just one meal.

89
00:10:46,567 --> 00:10:49,081
For prey, the stakes are higher.

90
00:10:49,167 --> 00:10:51,362
It's life or death.

91
00:11:04,167 --> 00:11:08,001
As Antarctica moves
from spring into summer,

92
00:11:08,087 --> 00:11:11,841
the inlets and bays
once choked with ice become free

93
00:11:16,887 --> 00:11:20,038
and animals move in to feed.

94
00:11:28,487 --> 00:11:32,719
These are crabeater seals.
They don't actually eat crabs,

95
00:11:32,807 --> 00:11:38,040
but krill, small shrimps that swarm
in their billions in these waters.

(SEAL BARKING)

97
00:11:41,727 --> 00:11:43,319
(SNORTING)

98
00:11:50,567 --> 00:11:52,797
Resting on a large ice floe,

99
00:11:52,887 --> 00:11:55,799
these crabeaters are safe.

100
00:12:06,047 --> 00:12:08,322
But as soon as they enter the water,

101
00:12:08,407 --> 00:12:10,363
they are on their guard,

102
00:12:11,487 --> 00:12:13,079
for good reason.

103
00:12:16,647 --> 00:12:18,478
Killer whales.

104
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:26,797
Here in Antarctica,
many killer whales prey only on fish.

105
00:12:26,887 --> 00:12:31,677
But these whales are different,
they specialise in hunting seals.

106
00:12:44,807 --> 00:12:47,367
This seal, swimming to open water,

107
00:12:47,447 --> 00:12:50,200
is unaware of
the danger heading his way.

108
00:12:54,567 --> 00:12:55,966
Until now.

109
00:13:00,527 --> 00:13:03,280
He's in real trouble.
There is no escape

110
00:13:03,367 --> 00:13:07,724
unless he can hide behind
this small piece of floating ice.

111
00:13:29,687 --> 00:13:32,645
But he's been spotted, and surrounded.

112
00:13:45,847 --> 00:13:48,566
Now agility is his only chance.

113
00:13:48,647 --> 00:13:53,243
He dodges for his life, staying
as close as he can to the iceberg.

114
00:14:04,527 --> 00:14:06,961
He's tiring,

115
00:14:07,047 --> 00:14:10,596
and the whales tighten the circle,
going for the kill.

116
00:14:38,167 --> 00:14:41,159
But hunters don't always
get their own way.

117
00:14:44,327 --> 00:14:47,603
In the end, the seal's
determination and skill,

118
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:51,475
using the ice for protection,
kept him just out of reach.

119
00:14:54,887 --> 00:14:56,878
And the whales move on.

120
00:15:02,407 --> 00:15:05,046
Recently, it's been observed
that killer whales

121
00:15:05,127 --> 00:15:09,166
are much more successful
when hunting other types of seal.

122
00:15:09,247 --> 00:15:12,557
Crabeaters like this
put up too much of a fight.

123
00:15:27,407 --> 00:15:29,841
For creatures living in the open ocean,

124
00:15:29,927 --> 00:15:32,919
there is nowhere to hide from predators.

125
00:15:33,007 --> 00:15:35,567
But there is safety in numbers.

126
00:16:00,807 --> 00:16:06,086
One fish, however,
has evolved a different escape tactic,

127
00:16:09,407 --> 00:16:13,685
to leave the water completely,
take to the air and fly!

128
00:16:19,527 --> 00:16:21,961
After a huge effort to get airborne,

129
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:25,676
flying fish can glide 200 metres or so

130
00:16:25,767 --> 00:16:28,361
to escape the predators chasing them.

But the battle between
animals and plants

134
00:17:20,727 --> 00:17:23,036

between one animal and one plant.

Brown tufted capuchins,
highly intelligent monkeys.

141
00:18:03,007 --> 00:18:05,601
They spend their nights
in the safety of caves,

142
00:18:05,687 --> 00:18:08,247
emerging each morning to find food.

143
00:18:14,247 --> 00:18:17,717
Down in the valley is
a particular favourite,

144
00:18:17,807 --> 00:18:19,479
a nut palm.

145
00:18:20,527 --> 00:18:23,564
The palms produce huge seeds,

146
00:18:23,647 --> 00:18:25,524
but they have very strong shells

147
00:18:25,607 --> 00:18:29,316
that protect them against
attack from hungry animals.

148
00:18:36,767 --> 00:18:40,362
For the capuchins,
this is a war of attrition.

149
00:18:44,247 --> 00:18:47,000
They check which seed is the ripest

150
00:18:47,087 --> 00:18:49,237
and the battle commences.

151
00:18:55,287 --> 00:19:00,122
The first job is to tear the tough,
fibrous husk from the nut.

152
00:19:05,647 --> 00:19:09,276
He doesn't try to
crack the nut straightaway,

153
00:19:09,367 --> 00:19:11,358
but drops it to the ground.

154
00:19:11,447 --> 00:19:16,521
He's learnt that a nut should be given
a week or so drying in the sun.

155
00:19:16,927 --> 00:19:19,282
These are ones he prepared earlier.

156
00:19:19,367 --> 00:19:21,961

Now something extraordinary happens.

00:20:16,407 --> 00:20:18,875
The capuchins' use of these stone tools

163
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:24,599
requires an exceptional level of
intelligence, planning and dexterity.

164
00:20:37,807 --> 00:20:40,162
The nut finally cracks

165
00:20:40,247 --> 00:20:44,126
and exposes a rich, oily kernel.

166
00:20:50,087 --> 00:20:52,840
Youngsters watch and imitate the adults,

167
00:20:52,927 --> 00:20:55,919
just as human toddlers do.

168
00:20:56,007 --> 00:21:00,637
If they are to become independent,
they must learn to crack their own nuts.

169
00:21:07,047 --> 00:21:11,404
But the learning process is long,
with many frustrations.

170
00:21:15,127 --> 00:21:19,120
They learn early on that
to do a job properly,

171
00:21:19,967 --> 00:21:21,923
you need the right tool.

172
00:21:31,367 --> 00:21:34,916
It can take eight years
for a capuchin to master this art

173
00:21:35,007 --> 00:21:38,477
and overcome the palm's
formidable defences.

174
00:21:49,287 --> 00:21:54,281
But some plants have turned
the tables and feed on animals.

175
00:21:59,367 --> 00:22:02,996
This is a highly sophisticated trap.

176
00:22:03,087 --> 00:22:07,717
The bait, sugary nectar
around the rim of the disc.

177
00:22:09,247 --> 00:22:12,398
The triggers, fine hairs,

178
00:22:12,487 --> 00:22:16,878
two of which have to be touched
within 20 seconds of each other.

179
00:22:20,727 --> 00:22:22,718
(FLY BUZZING)

180
00:22:25,007 --> 00:22:27,475
The victim, a fly,

181
00:22:27,567 --> 00:22:30,843
which finds the colour
and nectar irresistible.

182
00:22:39,087 --> 00:22:40,520
One...

183
00:22:53,047 --> 00:22:54,275
Two.

184
00:23:02,127 --> 00:23:05,722
When triggered,
the trap snaps shut so fast

185
00:23:05,807 --> 00:23:08,924
that the fly is imprisoned.

186
00:23:16,927 --> 00:23:21,921
The Venus Flytrap now
slowly digests its victim.

187
00:23:37,487 --> 00:23:41,241
Life's challenges are
more than just finding food.

188
00:23:41,327 --> 00:23:43,887
In every animal's life,
there comes a time

189
00:23:43,967 --> 00:23:46,925
when its mind turns to breeding.

190
00:23:48,567 --> 00:23:52,321
One creature's approach
is mind-boggling.

191
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:56,966
Malaysia.

192
00:24:11,167 --> 00:24:16,685
This strange insect has been
lying dormant on the forest floor.

193
00:24:46,087 --> 00:24:48,282
Once safe in the trees,

194
00:24:48,367 --> 00:24:50,676
these males hide among the leaves

195
00:24:50,767 --> 00:24:54,237
and begin
an extraordinary transformation,

196
00:24:55,567 --> 00:25:00,482
one that will make the difference
between fathering offspring or not.

197
00:25:03,687 --> 00:25:06,326
He begins by gulping in air bubbles,

198
00:25:06,407 --> 00:25:09,285
forcing them up into his head.

199
00:25:09,367 --> 00:25:10,516
(BUBBLING)

200
00:25:10,607 --> 00:25:14,885
He then pumps the bubbles
into the stalks supporting his eyes,

201
00:25:14,967 --> 00:25:17,242
just like blowing up a balloon.

202
00:25:24,087 --> 00:25:28,239
And this is what earns
these creatures their name,

203
00:25:28,327 --> 00:25:31,046
the stalk-eyed fly.

204
00:25:45,527 --> 00:25:47,722
A few final adjustments

205
00:25:47,807 --> 00:25:50,446
to straighten out any remaining creases

206
00:25:50,527 --> 00:25:52,643
and he's ready for action.

207
00:25:58,087 --> 00:26:01,124
They may look unwieldy,
but eyes on stalks

208
00:26:01,207 --> 00:26:04,517
improve not only
his ability to spot predators,

209
00:26:04,607 --> 00:26:08,441
but they are key
when it comes to winning females.

210
00:26:17,527 --> 00:26:20,485
In the evening,
both males and females gather,

211
00:26:20,567 --> 00:26:23,081
and the males begin to
size one another up,

212
00:26:23,167 --> 00:26:24,998
eyeball to eyeball.

213
00:26:25,847 --> 00:26:27,997
Having the widest eye span

214
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:31,318
puts you at the top
of the pecking order.

215
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:36,197
The eye stalks are not weapons,

216
00:26:36,287 --> 00:26:39,563
they're measuring sticks,
used to gauge how big,

217
00:26:39,647 --> 00:26:42,445
and so how strong, a male is.

218
00:26:42,527 --> 00:26:47,123
But there's trouble if two top males
have exactly the same eye width,

219
00:26:47,207 --> 00:26:51,041
then the contest descends into a brawl.

220
00:27:02,567 --> 00:27:04,046
Defeated.

221
00:27:05,647 --> 00:27:06,762
The winner.

222
00:27:06,847 --> 00:27:11,318
He now has the right to mate
with all the females nearby.

223
00:27:17,607 --> 00:27:19,563
The rather gentlemanly way

224
00:27:19,647 --> 00:27:22,764
stalk-eyed flies settle
their differences over females

225
00:27:22,847 --> 00:27:24,678
is not the only way.

226
00:27:24,767 --> 00:27:27,679
Some animals are much more violent.

227
00:27:27,767 --> 00:27:31,123
It's the dry season in Zambia.

228
00:27:32,047 --> 00:27:34,356
The lagoons are either baked dry

229
00:27:34,447 --> 00:27:36,039
or the mud is so thick

230
00:27:36,127 --> 00:27:40,564
animals get stuck,
with fatal consequences.

231
00:27:43,327 --> 00:27:46,717
This male hippo has been
living in one small lagoon

232
00:27:46,807 --> 00:27:51,119
but as it dries,
it's turning into a death trap.

233
00:27:52,487 --> 00:27:57,561
Understandably, the females that
once shared it with him have all left.

234
00:27:59,807 --> 00:28:01,035
Even if he wants to,

235
00:28:01,127 --> 00:28:03,163
he can't stay much longer.

236
00:28:04,607 --> 00:28:08,964
He needs water to keep cool
and females to mate with.

237
00:28:13,207 --> 00:28:15,960
And this is where they all are.

238
00:28:16,047 --> 00:28:18,038
Almost all the hippos in the area

239
00:28:18,127 --> 00:28:20,960
are now in what is left
of the Luangwa River,

240
00:28:21,047 --> 00:28:25,325
because it's the last place
where there's still deep water.

241
00:28:27,647 --> 00:28:31,435
This bend is controlled by
an all-powerful male.

242
00:28:31,527 --> 00:28:36,157
Since the drought, many more females
have joined his herd.

243
00:28:38,727 --> 00:28:42,402
(HIPPO GRUNTING)

244
00:28:45,367 --> 00:28:47,961
They are happy to live cheek by jowl,

245
00:28:48,047 --> 00:28:51,198
but any male who comes here
in the hope of mating

246
00:28:51,287 --> 00:28:54,040
must first defeat the overlord.

247
00:29:03,767 --> 00:29:07,726
The wandering male arrives
and has a decision to make,

248
00:29:07,807 --> 00:29:10,116
submit or fight.

249
00:30:20,407 --> 00:30:22,602
Victory for the overlord.

250
00:30:23,727 --> 00:30:27,481
His domination of his channel
in the river remains

251
00:30:27,567 --> 00:30:30,684
and with it,
mating rights with the females.

252
00:30:38,087 --> 00:30:41,796
The loser is alive, but is an outcast.

253
00:30:41,887 --> 00:30:44,355
He retreats to another part of the river

254
00:30:44,447 --> 00:30:47,757
where it is so shallow
that no females will follow.

255
00:30:50,287 --> 00:30:54,599
His chance to father offspring is over,
for now.

256
00:30:59,727 --> 00:31:02,366
For some animals,
the challenges of breeding

257
00:31:02,447 --> 00:31:05,564
are not about fighting,
but about courtship.

258
00:31:09,087 --> 00:31:12,796
Among birds, displays, songs and rituals

259
00:31:12,887 --> 00:31:16,402
can reach extraordinary levels
of complexity and beauty.

260
00:31:23,487 --> 00:31:26,718
During spring
on the freshwater lakes of Oregon,

261
00:31:26,807 --> 00:31:30,163
grebes join together to
renew their partnership.

262
00:31:45,287 --> 00:31:49,280
The ceremony starts with
a series of graceful duets,

263
00:31:49,367 --> 00:31:53,042
in which one partner echoes
the actions of the other.

264
00:31:59,127 --> 00:32:01,800
But the real test comes now.

265
00:32:03,647 --> 00:32:06,241
Only the strongest and the most faithful

266
00:32:06,327 --> 00:32:10,605
are prepared to join together
for the final exultant dance.

267
00:33:04,527 --> 00:33:09,806
Those animals which have young
now face a whole new set of challenges

268
00:33:09,887 --> 00:33:12,560
to protect and nurture their offspring.

269
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:21,162
In the cold waters of the northern
Pacific Ocean, there lives a giant.

270
00:33:27,807 --> 00:33:32,039
A giant Pacific octopus,
at over four metres long.

271
00:33:37,087 --> 00:33:41,160
She is hunting, not for prey,
but for a den.

272
00:33:41,247 --> 00:33:43,761
Somewhere to settle down and hide.

273
00:33:54,087 --> 00:33:56,681
Her den has to be just right.

274
00:33:58,487 --> 00:34:01,763
She is going to live here
for the rest of her life.

275
00:34:05,087 --> 00:34:07,442
She's carrying fertilised eggs,

276
00:34:08,327 --> 00:34:11,080
and now, happy and settled,
she lays them,

277
00:34:14,207 --> 00:34:16,437
1 00,000 of them.

278
00:34:22,967 --> 00:34:27,199
Over the next six months,
she carefully tends her precious brood.

279
00:34:31,207 --> 00:34:33,516
She caresses them with her arms

280
00:34:33,607 --> 00:34:37,520
to keep them free of algae
and properly supplied with oxygen.

281
00:34:40,327 --> 00:34:43,125
This is her first and only brood

282
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:46,721
and so she takes great care of them.

283
00:34:47,407 --> 00:34:51,036
While she's guarding her eggs,
she doesn't leave the den.

284
00:34:51,847 --> 00:34:53,121
Not once.

285
00:34:53,647 --> 00:34:56,639
Unable to feed, she is starving.

286
00:34:58,567 --> 00:35:00,478
Her last act of devotion

287
00:35:00,567 --> 00:35:03,764
is to blow water over the eggs
to help them hatch.

288
00:35:20,367 --> 00:35:23,916
Young, fully-developed octopus pop out.

289
00:35:29,367 --> 00:35:32,279
Though only a few will survive
to adulthood,

290
00:35:32,807 --> 00:35:35,879
she has given them
the best chance she can.

291
00:35:39,407 --> 00:35:44,037
After her long and lonely vigil,
she is dead.

292
00:35:45,167 --> 00:35:49,922
Surely this sacrifice must make her
one of nature's most devoted mothers.

293
00:36:00,447 --> 00:36:04,520
Here, 30 metres beneath
the Costa Rican forest canopy,

294
00:36:04,607 --> 00:36:07,883
another dedicated mother
ensures that her young

295
00:36:07,967 --> 00:36:10,765
also have the best possible start
in life.

296
00:36:17,207 --> 00:36:22,440
This tiny strawberry poison arrow frog,
only the size of a fingernail,

297
00:36:22,527 --> 00:36:24,836
is guarding her fertilised eggs.

298
00:36:28,327 --> 00:36:31,239
Whilst the eggs and tadpoles
are developing,

299
00:36:31,327 --> 00:36:33,363
she and her mate keep watch,

300
00:36:33,447 --> 00:36:36,484
making sure that
they are safe from predators.

301
00:36:37,687 --> 00:36:39,757
But they can't stay here forever.

302
00:36:39,847 --> 00:36:43,396
The leaf litter is drying out
and tadpoles need water.

303
00:36:44,367 --> 00:36:46,676
She must do something, and fast.

304
00:36:54,767 --> 00:36:56,405
She needs to move them,

305
00:36:56,487 --> 00:36:59,763
and so encourages one tadpole
to climb on her back.

306
00:37:00,767 --> 00:37:03,042
She now begins an epic journey.

307
00:37:04,207 --> 00:37:07,119
But it's not to a pond,
as you might expect,

308
00:37:07,687 --> 00:37:10,645
she is looking for
something very particular.

309
00:37:11,967 --> 00:37:14,435
Her journey takes her
across the forest floor

310
00:37:14,527 --> 00:37:16,199
to the foot of a tall tree.

311
00:37:16,287 --> 00:37:18,596
And then she starts to climb.

312
00:37:34,327 --> 00:37:37,876
For such a little frog,
it is a marathon ascent,

313
00:37:38,847 --> 00:37:41,998
like a human mother climbing
the Empire State Building

314
00:37:42,087 --> 00:37:44,078
with a child on her back.

315
00:37:47,167 --> 00:37:51,445
She's looking for a plant, a bromeliad,
growing on the tree.

316
00:37:57,287 --> 00:38:00,279
It holds a pool of water at its centre,

317
00:38:00,367 --> 00:38:03,723
the perfect nursery pool
for a developing tadpole.

318
00:38:07,927 --> 00:38:09,883
In slides her youngster.

319
00:38:17,807 --> 00:38:21,004
But this is only one of six tadpoles.

320
00:38:21,087 --> 00:38:24,045
She must rush back down
to rescue the others.

321
00:38:30,047 --> 00:38:34,484
One by one, she collects them
and carries each to its own bromeliad.

322
00:38:57,967 --> 00:39:00,276
But there is another problem.

323
00:39:00,367 --> 00:39:03,040
The little pools contain no food.

324
00:39:05,847 --> 00:39:07,917
So she has to provide it.

325
00:39:09,327 --> 00:39:14,117
She lays an unfertilised egg
in each pool for her tadpoles to eat.

326
00:39:20,887 --> 00:39:22,798
And then she leaves.

327
00:39:29,007 --> 00:39:32,841
But one egg won't sustain
a growing tadpole for long,

328
00:39:32,927 --> 00:39:36,317
so she has to return every few days
with another egg.

329
00:39:43,647 --> 00:39:47,481
Over the next two weeks,
she can climb almost half a mile

330
00:39:47,567 --> 00:39:49,239
tending her young,

331
00:39:50,487 --> 00:39:53,445
an astonishing feat
for such a tiny creature.

332
00:40:02,767 --> 00:40:04,917
While she is busy delivering eggs,

333
00:40:05,007 --> 00:40:09,285
the tadpole grows legs
and its tail begins to disappear.

334
00:40:11,927 --> 00:40:15,920
And then, one day, it leaves
its bromeliad nursery forever

335
00:40:16,007 --> 00:40:18,282
and climbs out into the forest,

336
00:40:23,607 --> 00:40:27,316
whilst its mother has
a well-deserved rest.

(WIND HOWLING)

338

Birds are also diligent parents.

Over their lifetime, they invest

But there is only so much
a parent can do.

342
00:40:51,367 --> 00:40:53,517
All along the Antarctic Peninsula,

343
00:40:53,607 --> 00:40:57,680
both male and female chinstrap penguins
have been commuting daily

344
00:40:57,767 --> 00:41:01,157
from the open ocean
to collect food for their chicks.

345
00:41:10,007 --> 00:41:13,283
Mouthfuls of krill,
caught many miles away at sea,

346
00:41:13,367 --> 00:41:15,005
are regurgitated.

347
00:41:23,687 --> 00:41:27,726
But one day
the chicks wait in vain for food.

348
00:41:27,807 --> 00:41:29,957
Their parents do not return.

349
00:41:32,407 --> 00:41:34,841
The chicks now face life on their own.

350
00:41:34,927 --> 00:41:38,715
This is the toughest time
in an animal's life,

351
00:41:38,807 --> 00:41:41,275
and some are not going to make it.

352
00:41:47,607 --> 00:41:50,326
Over the next few days,
driven by hunger,

353
00:41:50,407 --> 00:41:53,479
the chicks make their way
down to the shore.

354
00:41:55,367 --> 00:41:58,677
Instinct tells them
they have to head out to sea.

355
00:42:02,447 --> 00:42:04,597
Built to withstand the cold,

356
00:42:04,687 --> 00:42:07,326
they have already accumulated
a layer of fat

357
00:42:07,407 --> 00:42:10,797
and their outer feathers
act as a waterproof shield.

358
00:42:12,807 --> 00:42:15,446
But they still have to learn to swim.

359
00:42:38,887 --> 00:42:41,526
The polar sea is challenging enough,

360
00:42:42,247 --> 00:42:43,839
but with a change in the wind,

361
00:42:43,927 --> 00:42:47,078
a slick of broken ice
has choked the bay.

362
00:42:51,967 --> 00:42:55,357
For any penguin,
this ice presents a real problem.

363
00:42:57,927 --> 00:43:00,487
But for the chicks, it's a disaster.

364
00:43:05,767 --> 00:43:10,318
They must get through this barrier
to the open water if they are to feed.

365
00:43:16,247 --> 00:43:19,205
One, perhaps hungrier
or braver than the rest,

366
00:43:19,287 --> 00:43:23,041
leads the way
and tries skittering over the top

367
00:43:23,127 --> 00:43:25,038
while the others watch.

368
00:43:27,127 --> 00:43:31,086
The ice is hard to swim through,
and progress is painfully slow.

369
00:43:49,647 --> 00:43:51,160
(SQUAWKING)

370
00:43:54,207 --> 00:43:55,765
A leopard seal.

371
00:44:02,047 --> 00:44:06,086
This chick never had the chance
to learn how to avoid the seal.

372
00:44:06,167 --> 00:44:08,237
Its end is inevitable.

373
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:36,797
The leopard seal
efficiently flays the chick,

374
00:44:36,887 --> 00:44:39,720
tearing off a small piece
with each throw.

375
00:44:44,287 --> 00:44:46,323
Others take their chance.

376
00:45:25,767 --> 00:45:29,999
But the leopard seal is now ready
for its next victim.

377
00:45:47,127 --> 00:45:52,076
It's a lottery, and the lucky chicks
make it out to open water.

378
00:45:56,807 --> 00:46:00,243
There is still an element
of chance in life

379
00:46:00,327 --> 00:46:03,080
which an individual can do little about.

380
00:46:27,767 --> 00:46:31,157
In the end,
overcoming life's challenges,

381
00:46:31,247 --> 00:46:35,001
whether finding enough to eat
or outwitting your predators,

382
00:46:35,087 --> 00:46:39,319
is only significant if
life's final challenge can be met.

383
00:46:46,847 --> 00:46:52,444
From a tiny frog dedicating weeks
to her few cherished tadpoles

384
00:46:52,527 --> 00:46:57,647
to an orang-utan who spends eight years
bringing up her baby,

385
00:46:57,727 --> 00:47:02,642
individual animals strive to
reach this one ultimate goal,

386
00:47:02,727 --> 00:47:04,638
to pass on their genes

387
00:47:04,727 --> 00:47:07,924
and to ensure the survival
of the next generation.

388
00:47:11,287 --> 00:47:16,486
Ultimately, in nature,
that is what life is all about.

389
00:48:02,647 --> 00:48:05,320
During the three years it took
to film Life,

390
00:48:05,407 --> 00:48:08,956
our camera crews visited
every continent on Earth,

391
00:48:09,047 --> 00:48:11,880
but the most challenging was Antarctica.

392
00:48:16,287 --> 00:48:18,357
Here, filming was only possible

393
00:48:18,447 --> 00:48:22,645
with the help of an extraordinary range
of people and organisations.

394
00:48:23,687 --> 00:48:27,965
An Air Force jet delivering supplies
to McMurdo Research Station

395
00:48:28,047 --> 00:48:31,403
ferried one of our crews
to the Ross Ice Shelf.

396
00:48:39,567 --> 00:48:43,685
And on the other side of the continent,
a team sailed for five days

397
00:48:43,767 --> 00:48:47,919
across the Drake Passage
to reach the Antarctic Peninsula.

398
00:48:50,247 --> 00:48:53,956
Once there, a small crew was
put ashore on Deception Island

399
00:48:54,047 --> 00:48:57,676
to spend a month camping on the edge
of a penguin colony.

400
00:48:59,767 --> 00:49:03,476
Two people and 200,000 penguins.

401
00:49:10,647 --> 00:49:14,162
Another team joined
scientists drilling through the ice

402
00:49:14,247 --> 00:49:17,557
to explore the beautiful
and bizarre world below.

403
00:49:37,807 --> 00:49:40,275
But the hardest and most ambitious shoot

404
00:49:40,367 --> 00:49:42,642
involved four film crews,

405
00:49:42,727 --> 00:49:47,084
a celebrated French yachtsman
and the Ministry of Defence.

406
00:49:51,407 --> 00:49:53,637
The teams had a two-month window

407
00:49:53,727 --> 00:49:57,720
to film Antarctica's two top predators
in action.

408
00:49:59,207 --> 00:50:03,325
We knew that one could be found
prowling the coast of Rosenthal Island,

409
00:50:03,407 --> 00:50:06,843
waiting for young penguins
to take their first plunge.

410
00:50:08,407 --> 00:50:11,604
And the man to take us there
was Jerome Poncet.

411
00:50:11,687 --> 00:50:15,600
He skippered the first yacht
to sail south of the Antarctic Circle

412
00:50:15,687 --> 00:50:18,440
and has been back every year
for the past 35.

413
00:50:18,527 --> 00:50:21,519
He knows Antarctic sailing
like no one else.

414
00:50:21,607 --> 00:50:22,801
Not good at all.

415
00:50:22,887 --> 00:50:26,482
His yacht, The Golden Fleece,
is not an ice-breaker

416
00:50:26,567 --> 00:50:29,957
but Jerome has his own unique way
of getting through.

417
00:50:32,447 --> 00:50:34,961
He shunts one floe against another

418
00:50:35,047 --> 00:50:37,800
to clear a way through,
like playing marbles.

419
00:50:37,887 --> 00:50:42,165
Jerome, once he gets his teeth
into a situation,

420
00:50:42,247 --> 00:50:44,317
he doesn't like to let it go.

421
00:50:44,407 --> 00:50:47,444
So, maybe we'll be here
for a few hours yet.

422
00:50:47,527 --> 00:50:50,325
ATTENBOROUGH: Jerome is determined
to get through this channel.

423
00:50:50,407 --> 00:50:54,241
And you talk about
hundreds and hundreds of turns.

424
00:50:54,327 --> 00:50:58,400
Maybe a thousand turns
for this floe at the moment.

425
00:50:59,247 --> 00:51:01,636
With the polar waters, you have to push.

426
00:51:05,207 --> 00:51:08,085
ATTENBOROUGH:
Some marbles are just too big.

427
00:51:11,967 --> 00:51:16,245
For now,Jerome is foiled
and has to moor for the night.

428
00:51:17,927 --> 00:51:21,966
For him, tying up to 1 00,000 tons of ice

429
00:51:22,047 --> 00:51:24,515
is just another day at the office.

430
00:51:31,327 --> 00:51:33,045
Progress is slow.

431
00:51:33,127 --> 00:51:37,200
But they need to get to Rosenthal
before the penguins leave.

432
00:51:38,927 --> 00:51:42,442
They make it through
and the penguins are still there.

433
00:51:44,967 --> 00:51:49,085
Chinstrap penguin chicks fledge
at a particular time of year.

434
00:51:49,167 --> 00:51:53,240
The crew knew this would
draw leopard seals like a magnet.

435
00:51:55,047 --> 00:51:57,356
Leopard seals are giants
among their kind.

436
00:51:57,447 --> 00:51:59,756
They have teeth bigger than a lion

437
00:51:59,847 --> 00:52:03,886
and a mouth than can open
nearly 1 80 degrees.

438
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:05,958
How close can Doug get?

439
00:52:11,287 --> 00:52:13,482
With this seal, very.

440
00:52:30,207 --> 00:52:32,846
He loses interest in his reflection

441
00:52:34,047 --> 00:52:36,800
and goes back to eating penguins.

442
00:52:47,927 --> 00:52:51,476
That was very exciting.
He was a super seal.

443
00:52:52,887 --> 00:52:55,799
Super seal give you lots of action,
nice and close.

444
00:52:55,887 --> 00:52:59,084
But I must admit, you do have to
feel sorry for the penguin.

445
00:52:59,167 --> 00:53:01,044
Just doesn't stand a chance.

446
00:53:02,087 --> 00:53:04,362
ATTENBOROUGH: The team knew
where to find leopard seals

447
00:53:04,447 --> 00:53:08,998
but finding the other top predator
was going to be another matter entirely.

448
00:53:11,247 --> 00:53:14,603
Very little is known about
Antarctic killer whales.

449
00:53:14,687 --> 00:53:17,326
Time to bring in reinforcements.

450
00:53:19,767 --> 00:53:25,683
HMS Endurance,
the Royal Navy's ice patrol ship.

451
00:53:30,247 --> 00:53:35,275
She surveys Antarctic waters
and the crew, she changes every year.

452
00:53:35,367 --> 00:53:37,597
A latest chart of this area,

453
00:53:37,687 --> 00:53:41,362
we are now six miles
inside an ice shelf,

454
00:53:41,447 --> 00:53:45,042
which just goes to show
how much retraction

455
00:53:45,127 --> 00:53:49,086
of this ice shelf has occurred
over the past five or six years.

456
00:53:50,287 --> 00:53:52,482
Would you get complications...

457
00:53:52,567 --> 00:53:56,037
Series producer Martha Holmes
and cameraman David Baillie

458
00:53:56,127 --> 00:53:59,961
were on board to find and film
the killer whales from the air.

459
00:54:01,047 --> 00:54:03,607
Endurance carries two Lynx helicopters,

460
00:54:03,687 --> 00:54:06,326
used to assist
the British Antarctic Survey

461
00:54:06,407 --> 00:54:08,363
and the Hydrographic Office.

462
00:54:08,447 --> 00:54:11,598
On this trip,
some time on one of the helicopters

463
00:54:11,687 --> 00:54:13,882
is assigned to the Life team.

464
00:54:23,047 --> 00:54:25,880
No one has succeeded
in filming killer whales

465
00:54:25,967 --> 00:54:29,562
hunting off
the Antarctic Peninsula before.

466
00:54:30,327 --> 00:54:34,320
Our two teams have just a few days
when they can film together.

467
00:54:42,087 --> 00:54:45,363
At water level,
The Golden Fleece has exciting news.

468
00:54:45,447 --> 00:54:49,599
They've found killer whales which look
as though they could be hunting.

469
00:54:49,687 --> 00:54:52,326
Navy 4 35, Navy 4 35.

470
00:54:52,407 --> 00:54:55,285
This is Golden Fleece,
Golden Fleece, over.

471
00:54:56,367 --> 00:54:59,757
SMITH ON RADIO: Whale or orca.
This could be it. Over.

472
00:54:59,847 --> 00:55:02,122
HOLMES ON RADIO:
Copy that. We're on our way.

473
00:55:02,207 --> 00:55:04,846
Now it's getting really windy
where we are.

474
00:55:04,927 --> 00:55:07,885
We'll be pretty lucky to
stay with them through this.

475
00:55:07,967 --> 00:55:10,242
We'll give a good try, though.

476
00:55:19,367 --> 00:55:21,801
4 35, this is Golden Fleece.

477
00:55:21,887 --> 00:55:24,117
We have lost sight of the orca.

478
00:55:24,767 --> 00:55:27,122
(INDISTINCT CHATTER ON RADIO)

479
00:55:27,207 --> 00:55:28,242
We have one.

480
00:55:28,327 --> 00:55:30,887
HOLMES: Yeah. They're in direct line
with that iceberg now.

481
00:55:30,967 --> 00:55:34,926
Between us and the iceberg,
about 1 00 metres to the side of it.

482
00:55:35,007 --> 00:55:37,237
MAN: Visual. We have visual.

483
00:55:37,327 --> 00:55:38,396
ATTENBOROUGH: From the air,

484
00:55:38,487 --> 00:55:40,637
the helicopter team
can follow the killer whales

485
00:55:40,727 --> 00:55:42,638
more easily than the boat team.

486
00:55:42,727 --> 00:55:46,720
4 35, this is Golden Fleece. Copy. Out.

487
00:55:51,287 --> 00:55:54,040
ATTENBOROUGH: By working together,
the helicopter and yacht

488
00:55:54,127 --> 00:55:57,961
are able to keep track of the whales
in the rough sea.

489
00:55:58,047 --> 00:55:59,446
MAN ON RADIO: There are four now,
actually, yeah.

490
00:55:59,527 --> 00:56:01,916
Four... Four I can see.

491
00:56:02,007 --> 00:56:06,319
ATTENBOROUGH: A change in the weather
gives the chance to film at last.

492
00:56:07,727 --> 00:56:11,800
They've gone further up this way.
If we follow them, that's good.

493
00:56:15,087 --> 00:56:16,281
But will they hunt?

494
00:56:16,367 --> 00:56:19,120
Here we go. Okay, they're coming close.

495
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:22,765
(ExCLAIMS) Yeah, they...
One, two, three, four, five, six...

496
00:56:22,847 --> 00:56:25,156
It's a good 1 2, huh? Easy.

497
00:56:27,687 --> 00:56:31,157
Doug has spotted
a crabeater seal near some ice.

498
00:56:31,247 --> 00:56:33,715
But have the killer whales seen it?

499
00:56:35,527 --> 00:56:38,963
DOUG: Just keep nosing in
this way is fine.

500
00:56:52,047 --> 00:56:54,083
ATTENBOROUGH: They have.

501
00:56:55,527 --> 00:56:57,245
Some good action.

502
00:56:59,007 --> 00:57:00,725
Can we go closer?

503
00:57:21,727 --> 00:57:24,639
It's over. That's it, they've got him.

504
00:57:28,287 --> 00:57:29,959
It's still there!

505
00:57:33,447 --> 00:57:37,645
ATTENBOROUGH: For a wildlife cameraman,
there are always surprises.

506
00:57:40,167 --> 00:57:43,557
It has taken two months
but they've succeeded,

507
00:57:43,647 --> 00:57:46,081
thanks to extraordinary collaboration,

508
00:57:46,167 --> 00:57:50,240
from an entire ship's company
to a lone skipper.

509
00:57:50,327 --> 00:57:51,680
Collaborations like this

510
00:57:51,767 --> 00:57:54,804
would be the foundation
of the whole three years' filming

511
00:57:54,887 --> 00:57:56,798
across the world.
