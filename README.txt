For the code Algorithm Speech-to-Text:

The only parameters to change are:

- The path of the credential_file, which has to be linked to a Google Cloud account
- The path for the audio file studied
- The path for the subtitles file for the movie studied
- The path to save the transcript

Then the final part of the code can run without any other change and a file will be created within nearly 20 min (for an audio file of 10 min )and will produce the precise transcript with timestamp for the studied audio file.
