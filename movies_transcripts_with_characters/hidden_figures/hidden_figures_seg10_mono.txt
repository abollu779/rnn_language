62.4: OTHER: PlanckEinstein...

65.3: KATHERINE: The
65.7: KATHERINE: problem
66.3: KATHERINE: is
66.9: KATHERINE: when
67.1: KATHERINE: the
67.2: KATHERINE: capsule
67.8: KATHERINE: moves
68.2: KATHERINE: from
68.4: KATHERINE: an
68.5: KATHERINE: elliptical
69.0: KATHERINE: orbit
69.4: KATHERINE: to

71.7: KATHERINE: There's

83.3: AL HARRISON: Maybe
83.8: AL HARRISON: we've
83.9: AL HARRISON: been
83.9: AL HARRISON: thinking

85.4: PAUL STAFFORD: How's

91.1: AL HARRISON: Maybe
91.5: AL HARRISON: it's
91.7: AL HARRISON: not
91.8: AL HARRISON: new
91.9: AL HARRISON: math
92.2: AL HARRISON: at
92.3: AL HARRISON: all.

94.8: KATHERINE: It
95.2: KATHERINE: could
95.4: KATHERINE: be
95.6: KATHERINE: old
95.8: KATHERINE: math.

97.5: KATHERINE: Something
98.1: KATHERINE: that

98.4: KATHERINE: at
98.5: KATHERINE: the
98.6: KATHERINE: problem
99.0: KATHERINE: numerically,
99.4: KATHERINE: and
99.8: KATHERINE: not
100.0: KATHERINE: theoretically

101.5: KATHERINE: Math

112.2: KATHERINE: Euler's
112.8: KATHERINE: Method.

113.4: KATHERINE: Euler's
114.0: KATHERINE: Method?

113.4: KATHERINE: Yes.

115.5: PAUL STAFFORD: That's
116.2: PAUL STAFFORD: ancient.

115.3: KATHERINE: But
115.5: KATHERINE: it
115.7: KATHERINE: works!

118.7: KATHERINE: It
119.1: KATHERINE: works
119.3: KATHERINE: numerically.

156.5: PAUL STAFFORD: That's
157.0: PAUL STAFFORD: it!

160.1: PAUL STAFFORD: Let's
