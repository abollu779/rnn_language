28.1: OTHER: Yes?

31.1: MARY: I'm
31.5: MARY: Mary
31.9: MARY: Jackson.
32.1: MARY: I'm
32.3: MARY: enrolled.

35.9: OTHER: Well.
36.3: OTHER: The
36.7: OTHER: curriculum

38.9: OTHER: a
39.1: OTHER: woman.

39.7: MARY: Well,
40.7: MARY: I
40.7: MARY: imagine
40.7: MARY: it's
40.7: MARY: the
41.7: MARY: same
41.9: MARY: as
42.1: MARY: teaching
42.3: MARY: a

59.2: OTHER: OK.

61.7: OTHER: PlanckEinstein...

64.6: KATHERINE: The
65.4: KATHERINE: problem
65.4: KATHERINE: is
66.4: KATHERINE: when
66.4: KATHERINE: the
66.4: KATHERINE: capsule
67.4: KATHERINE: moves
67.4: KATHERINE: from
68.4: KATHERINE: an
68.4: KATHERINE: elliptical
68.9: KATHERINE: orbit
69.4: KATHERINE: to
69.4: KATHERINE: a
69.6: KATHERINE: parabolic
69.8: KATHERINE: orbit.

70.9: KATHERINE: There's
71.9: KATHERINE: no
71.9: KATHERINE: mathematical
71.9: KATHERINE: formula
71.9: KATHERINE: for
72.1: KATHERINE: that.

74.4: KATHERINE: As
74.4: KATHERINE: we
74.4: KATHERINE: can
74.4: KATHERINE: calculate
74.6: KATHERINE: launch,
74.8: KATHERINE: landing

76.9: KATHERINE: but
76.9: KATHERINE: without
76.9: KATHERINE: this
76.9: KATHERINE: conversion,
77.9: KATHERINE: the
78.4: KATHERINE: capsule
78.9: KATHERINE: stays
78.9: KATHERINE: in
78.9: KATHERINE: orbit,
78.9: KATHERINE: we
79.1: KATHERINE: can't
79.3: KATHERINE: bring
79.5: KATHERINE: it
79.7: KATHERINE: back
79.9: KATHERINE: home.

82.5: AL HARRISON: Maybe
83.5: AL HARRISON: we've
83.5: AL HARRISON: been
83.5: AL HARRISON: thinking
83.5: AL HARRISON: about
83.5: AL HARRISON: this
83.7: AL HARRISON: all
83.9: AL HARRISON: wrong.

84.6: PAUL STAFFORD: How's
85.6: PAUL STAFFORD: that?

90.2: AL HARRISON: Maybe
91.2: AL HARRISON: it's
91.2: AL HARRISON: not
91.2: AL HARRISON: new
91.4: AL HARRISON: math
91.6: AL HARRISON: at
91.8: AL HARRISON: all.

94.8: KATHERINE: It
94.8: KATHERINE: could
94.8: KATHERINE: be
95.0: KATHERINE: old
95.2: KATHERINE: math.

96.7: KATHERINE: Something
97.7: KATHERINE: that
97.7: KATHERINE: looks
97.7: KATHERINE: at
97.7: KATHERINE: the
97.7: KATHERINE: problem
97.9: KATHERINE: numerically,
98.1: KATHERINE: and
98.3: KATHERINE: not
98.5: KATHERINE: theoretically

100.6: KATHERINE: Math
101.6: KATHERINE: is
101.6: KATHERINE: always
101.6: KATHERINE: dependable.

100.8: AL HARRISON: For
101.1: AL HARRISON: you
101.3: AL HARRISON: it
101.6: AL HARRISON: is.

111.5: KATHERINE: Euler's
111.7: KATHERINE: Method.

112.5: KATHERINE: Euler's
113.5: KATHERINE: Method?

112.7: KATHERINE: Yes.

115.4: PAUL STAFFORD: That's
115.4: PAUL STAFFORD: ancient.

114.4: KATHERINE: But
114.6: KATHERINE: it
114.8: KATHERINE: works!

117.9: KATHERINE: It
118.9: KATHERINE: works
119.1: KATHERINE: numerically.

155.6: PAUL STAFFORD: That's
156.6: PAUL STAFFORD: it!

159.4: PAUL STAFFORD: Let's
161.4: PAUL STAFFORD: type
163.4: PAUL STAFFORD: it
165.4: PAUL STAFFORD: up.
