28.9: OTHER: Yes?

31.8: MARY: I
32.0: MARY: am
32.2: MARY: Mary
32.4: MARY: Jackson.
32.6: MARY: I

36.6: OTHER: Well.
36.9: OTHER: The

38.9: OTHER: a
39.1: OTHER: woman.

40.4: MARY: Well,
40.9: MARY: I
41.0: MARY: imagine
41.2: MARY: it
41.4: MARY: is
41.5: MARY: the
41.6: MARY: same
41.9: MARY: as
41.9: MARY: teaching
42.1: MARY: a
42.3: MARY: man.

44.4: MARY: I

59.9: OTHER: OK.

62.4: OTHER: PlanckEinstein...

65.3: KATHERINE: The
65.6: KATHERINE: problem
66.2: KATHERINE: is
66.9: KATHERINE: when
67.0: KATHERINE: the
67.2: KATHERINE: capsule
67.7: KATHERINE: moves
68.1: KATHERINE: from
68.3: KATHERINE: an
68.5: KATHERINE: elliptical
68.9: KATHERINE: orbit
69.4: KATHERINE: to
69.7: KATHERINE: a
69.8: KATHERINE: parabolic
70.0: KATHERINE: orbit.

71.8: KATHERINE: There
72.0: KATHERINE: is
72.2: KATHERINE: no
72.4: KATHERINE: mathematical
72.6: KATHERINE: formula
72.8: KATHERINE: for
73.0: KATHERINE: that.

74.4: KATHERINE: As
74.8: KATHERINE: we
74.9: KATHERINE: can
75.0: KATHERINE: calculate
75.2: KATHERINE: launch,
75.4: KATHERINE: landing

77.1: KATHERINE: but
77.3: KATHERINE: without
77.5: KATHERINE: this
77.7: KATHERINE: conversion,
78.2: KATHERINE: the

79.1: KATHERINE: stays
79.4: KATHERINE: in
79.5: KATHERINE: orbit,
79.7: KATHERINE: we
79.9: KATHERINE: can
79.9: KATHERINE: not
80.1: KATHERINE: bring
80.2: KATHERINE: it
80.3: KATHERINE: back
80.4: KATHERINE: home.

83.2: AL HARRISON: Maybe
83.7: AL HARRISON: we
83.7: AL HARRISON: have
83.8: AL HARRISON: been
83.8: AL HARRISON: thinking
84.1: AL HARRISON: about
84.4: AL HARRISON: this
84.6: AL HARRISON: all
84.7: AL HARRISON: wrong.

85.4: PAUL STAFFORD: How's
85.9: PAUL STAFFORD: that?

91.0: AL HARRISON: Maybe
91.2: AL HARRISON: it
91.5: AL HARRISON: is
91.6: AL HARRISON: not
91.7: AL HARRISON: new
91.9: AL HARRISON: math
92.1: AL HARRISON: at
92.2: AL HARRISON: all.

94.7: KATHERINE: It
95.2: KATHERINE: could
95.4: KATHERINE: be
95.5: KATHERINE: old
95.9: KATHERINE: math.

97.5: KATHERINE: Something
98.0: KATHERINE: that
98.1: KATHERINE: looks
98.3: KATHERINE: at
98.5: KATHERINE: the
98.6: KATHERINE: problem
99.0: KATHERINE: numerically,
99.3: KATHERINE: and
99.8: KATHERINE: not
100.0: KATHERINE: theoretically

101.5: KATHERINE: Math
102.1: KATHERINE: is
102.7: KATHERINE: always
103.3: KATHERINE: dependable.
103.9: AL HARRISON: For
104.6: AL HARRISON: you
104.8: AL HARRISON: it
105.0: AL HARRISON: is.

112.1: KATHERINE: Euler's
112.8: KATHERINE: Method.

113.4: KATHERINE: Euler's
114.0: KATHERINE: Method?
114.2: KATHERINE: Yes.

115.3: PAUL STAFFORD: That
115.4: PAUL STAFFORD: is
116.1: PAUL STAFFORD: ancient.
116.5: KATHERINE: But
117.5: KATHERINE: it
117.6: KATHERINE: works!

118.6: KATHERINE: It
119.0: KATHERINE: works
119.2: KATHERINE: numerically.

156.5: PAUL STAFFORD: That
156.5: PAUL STAFFORD: is
157.0: PAUL STAFFORD: it!

160.1: PAUL STAFFORD: Let's
