LITTLE GIRL: 14, 15, 16...prime. 18, prime.
LITTLE GIRL: 20, 21, 22, prime, 24, 25, 26...
JOYLETTE COLEMAN: Katherine! Come on now!
KATHERINE: Isosceles, scalene, obtuse, equilateral, rhombus...
KATHERINE: Trapezoid, tetrahedron, octahedron, dodecahedron...
MARION SMITHSON: West Virginia Collegiate Institute is the best school for Negros in the state.
MS. SUMNER: It’s the only school, past the eighth grade, anywhere close to here.
JOSHUA COLEMAN: Katherine’s in the sixth grade.
MS. SUMNER: They want to take her early.
MARION SMITHSON: They’re offering a full scholarship. All you have to do is get there.
MS. SUMNER: Joshua, Joylette...we took up a collection amongst the teachers and such, a few parents.
MS. SUMNER: It’s not a whole lot, but it’ll surely help get you settled in.
JOYLETTE COLEMAN: That’s beyond kind, Ms. Sumner.
MS. SUMNER: In all my years of teaching, I’ve never seen a mind like the one your daughter has. You have to go. You have to see what she becomes.
PROFESSOR GRAVES: Ms. Coleman.
PROFESSOR GRAVES: You find something out there more interesting than quadratic equations?
KATHERINE: Yes, sir. I mean no, sir.
PROFESSOR GRAVES: Why don’t you figure out the equation on the board?
PROFESSOR GRAVES: Go on.
KATHERINE: If the product of two terms is zero, then common sense says at least one of the two terms has to be zero to start with. So, if you move all the terms over to one side, you can put the quadratics into a form that can be factored, allowing that side of the equation to equal zero. Once you’ve done that, it’s pretty straight forward from there...
KATHERINE: ...sir.
DOROTHY: Try and turn it over!
DOROTHY: Katherine?
DOROTHY: Mary?
MARY: Katherine? Quit staring off into space! Turn the damn car over!
KATHERINE: I got it. I’m not deaf.
MARY: I wonder some times.
KATHERINE: Here it goes.
DOROTHY: That’s the starter. It’s definitely the starter.
MARY: That starter’s startin’ to make us late. We’re all gonna be unemployed driving this hunk of junk to work everyday.
DOROTHY: You’re welcome to walk the 16 miles.
KATHERINE: Or sit on the back of the bus.
MARY: Won’t do neither. I’ll hitchhike.
MARY: Girls.
DOROTHY: No crime in a broken down car.
MARY: No crime being Negro either.
KATHERINE: Button it up, Mary. No one wants to go to jail behind your mouth.
MARY: I’ll do my best, sugar.
WHITE COP: Not a great place for the three of ya’ll to be havin’ car trouble.
MARY: We didn’t pick the place, Officer. It picked us.
WHITE COP: You bein’ disrespectful?
MARY: No, sir.
WHITE COP: You have identification on ya?
KATHERINE: We sure do. We’re just on our way to work. At Langley.
KATHERINE: NASA, sir.
DOROTHY: We do a great deal of the calculating getting our rockets into space.
WHITE COP: All three of ya?
MARY: Yes, Officer.
WHITE COP: NASA. That’s somethin’. Had no idea they hired-
DOROTHY: There are quite a few women working in the Space Program, sir.
WHITE COP: Damn Russians are watching us right now. Sputniks.
WHITE COP: You girls ever meet those Astronauts? The Mercury 7?
MARY: Absolutely.
WHITE COP: Alan Shepard? John Glenn?
KATHERINE: We work with those gentlemen all the time.
WHITE COP: Those boys are the best we got. That’s for sure. We have-ta get a man up there before the Commies do. Whole damn country’s counting on ‘em.
DOROTHY: That’s for certain.
MARY: Hard to be of service broken down on the side of the road though.
WHITE COP: That’s right. That’s right. You need a tow or somethin’?
DOROTHY: No, thank you, Officer. I think I got it, right here. Just have to bypass the starter...
DOROTHY: That’a girl. We’re all set.
WHITE COP: Hell. Least I can do is give ya an escort. Imagine ya’ll are running late.
KATHERINE: Oh, we wouldn’t want to trouble you.
MARY: That would be wonderful, Officer.
DOROTHY: Slow down, Mary! You’re too close!
MARY: He said to follow him.
DOROTHY: Doesn’t mean you hit him in the ass!
KATHERINE: Dear Lord...please...I don’t even know where to begin!
MARY: I’ll tell you where to begin- three “colored” women are chasing a white police officer down the highway in Hampton, Virginia, 1961. Ladies, that there is a God ordained miracle!
CRACKLING VOICE: Approximate speed- 17,400 mph. Ascend angle- 42.46. Closing.
PRESIDENT’S AIDE: Latest intelligence on the Soviet booster rocket still in relay, Mr. President.
CRACKLING VOICE: Disengage booster rocket. We are go.
CRACKLING VOICE: Orbital entry is...go.
RUSSIAN MILITARY ANNOUNCER: All systems safe. Confirmed. Orbital entry is established.
RUSSIAN SCIENTIST: Zvezdochka is ready to go again. So is our comrade, Ivan.
RUSSIAN SCIENTIST: Now it is time. Mother Russia will be first to put a human in space.
JIM WEBB: A goddamn dog! And a goddamn mannequin!
JIM WEBB: And then a 1.6 megaton RDS-37 thermonuclear warhead drops down in the middle of Des Moines.
PAUL STAFFORD: Well, that’s a pretty big jump, sir.
JIM WEBB: Who the hell is he?
AL HARRISON: Paul Stafford...our Lead Engineer, Mr. Webb. I think what he meant to say is that speculation, at least on our side of the equation, can be dangerous.
JIM WEBB: You know what’s dangerous...inaction. Inaction and indecision. The Russians have a spy satellite lapping the planet. Taking pictures of God knows what. The President is demanding an immediate response. No more delays. Alan Shepard, John Glenn, your uncle Bob. Doesn’t matter, just get us up there, Harrison. We can’t justify a space program that doesn't put anything in space.
AL HARRISON: How did that feel in there, Paul? Do you think you enlightened the Administrator?
AL HARRISON: He didn’t look enlightened to me.
AL HARRISON: He look enlightened to you, Sam?
SAM TURNER: Not particularly.
AL HARRISON: And just so you know, he’s not wrong about what he said in there. You know that, right? Because now that they can get up there, a bomb will follow. That’s what happens to all our good ideas.
AL HARRISON: Where’s the machine?
RUTH: Any day now, Mr. Harrison.
AL HARRISON: Any day now. What’s it called? The initials...the letters
RUTH: IBM.
PAUL STAFFORD: International business machine.
AL HARRISON: Space is business. I need a mathematician.
RUTH: I’ll put in another request, sir.
AL HARRISON: Another request. Jesus Christ. We don’t have a single person, in this entire building, that can handle Analytic Geometry?
RUTH: That’s what I’ve been told.
AL HARRISON: Well, tell me something else, Ruth. Like we’re going to find such a person, before the Russians plant a flag on the damn moon.
DOROTHY: Eleanor you’re with Bernie today in Data Reduction, Building 202.
ELEANOR: Date Reduction?
DOROTHY: You’re welcome to join the charmers in Magnetoplasmadynamics.
ELEANOR: No thank you, ma’am. Data Reduction’s just fine.
DOROTHY: Mary.
MARY: Present.
DOROTHY: The Mercury 7 prototype has arrived for testing. Mr. Zielinski’s requesting you...for permanent assignment.
MARY: Are you serious?
DOROTHY: Get moving.
MARY: Thank you. Thank you! Thank you, Jesus!
DOROTHY: Keep it inside, hon. The other girls...
MARY: Sorry, Dor.
DOROTHY: Mrs. Mitchell.
VIVIAN MITCHELL: We’re on double time this mornin’, girls. I need these calculations before lunch.
VIVIAN MITCHELL: The Space Task Group needs a computer ASAP. Someone with a handle on Analytic Geometry. Much to my chagrin, we can’t fill the position outta the East Group.
DOROTHY: Permanent or temp?
VIVIAN MITCHELL: Everything’s temporary, Dorothy. You have someone?
DOROTHY: Yes, ma’am. Katherine’s the gal for that.
DOROTHY: She can handle any numbers you put in front of her.
VIVIAN MITCHELL: I’ll check her credentials.
VIVIAN MITCHELL: Didn’t think of comin’ all the way down here.
DOROTHY: Mrs. Mitchell...if I could-
DOROTHY: My application for supervisor, ma’am. Was wondering if they’re still considering me for that position.
VIVIAN MITCHELL: Yes. Well, the official word is- no. They’re not assignin’ a permanent supervisor to the Colored Group.
DOROTHY: I see. May I ask why?
VIVIAN MITCHELL: I don’t know “why.” I didn’t ask “why.”
DOROTHY: We need a Supervisor, ma’am. Haven’t had one since Ms. Jansen got sick. Been almost a year.
VIVIAN MITCHELL: Things are workin’ just fine as is, Dorothy.
DOROTHY: I do the work of a Supervisor. I’m in charge of the Group, like a Supervisor.
VIVIAN MITCHELL: That’s NASA, for ya. Fast with rocket ships. Slow with advancement. Get those trajectories calcs worked out. We need ‘em for the Redstone test.
PA ANNOUNCER: Mach 2 tunnel test, T-minus one minute.
ZIELINSKI: No shoe is worth your life.
PA ANNOUNCER: Mach 2 tunnel test, T-minus ten, nine, eight...
PA ANNOUNCER: Seven, six, five...
ZIELINSKI: If we alter the exterior from smooth to corrugated, the capsule would have more stability, despite the air displacement.
MARY: The area closest to the boosters is closest to the heat.
MARY: Coupled with rising temperatures on reentry, the contacts soften. We could consider another fastener other than bolts.
ZIELINSKI: There’s another opening in the Engineer Training Program.
MARY: Flat head rivets could reduce wind drag.
ZIELINSKI: Mary...a person with an engineer’s mind should be an engineer. You can’t be a Computer the rest of your life. That would be a tragic waste of your ability.
MARY: Mr. Zielinski, I’m a Negro woman. I’m not going to entertain the impossible.
ZIELINSKI: And I’m a polish Jew whose parents died in a Nazi prison camp. Now I’m standing beneath a space ship that’s going to carry an astronaut to the stars. I think we can say, we’re living the impossible. Let me ask...if you were a white male, would you wish to be an engineer?
MARY: I wouldn’t have to. I’d already be one
VIVIAN MITCHELL: Skirts must be worn past the knee. Sweaters are preferred to blouses. No jewelry. A simple pearl necklace is the exception.
VIVIAN MITCHELL: Your supervisor is Mr. Al Harrison, Director of the Space Task Group. You’ll write research, proof calculations, so forth. Don’t talk to Mr. Harrison lest he talks to you. Not many Computers last more than a few days, he’s been through a dozen in as many months. Your clearance.
VIVIAN MITCHELL: They’ve never had a colored in here before, Katherine. Don’t embarrass me.
SAM TURNER: This wasn’t emptied last night.
KATHERINE: I’m sorry. I’m not-
KATHERINE: Excuse me, ma’am, Mr. Harrison’s Computer reporting.
RUTH: Take the desk in the corner. I’ll get you work in a bit.
RUTH: Mr. Harrison won’t warm up to you, don’t expect it. Do your work, keep your head down.
KATHERINE: Thank you.
RUTH: Go on. Get settled.
AL HARRISON: Stafford, why are we still losing shingles off our heat shield?
STAFFORD: We’re working with a prototype of the capsule, Al. It’s one third the size-
AL HARRISON: Well, do we need to turn our million dollar fan down, Karl?
ZIELINSKI: No, Al. I don’t think-
AL HARRISON: Of course not. That was a joke.
AL HARRISON: Paul. If the heat shield comes off, what do you think happens to our astronaut?
AL HARRISON: So we’re going to come up with a solve, right?
STAFFORD: Yes, sir. We’re working on it.
AL HARRISON: Ruth. What’s the status on my Computer?
RUTH: She’s right in front of you, Mr. Harrison.
AL HARRISON: Does she know how to handle Analytic Geometry?
RUTH: Absolutely. And she speaks.
KATHERINE: I do, sir.
AL HARRISON: Which one?
KATHERINE: Both, sir. Geometry and speaking.
AL HARRISON: Then give her the-
AL HARRISON: Do you think you can find me the Frenet frame for that data using the GramSchmidt--
KATHERINE: --Orthogonalization algorithm. Yes, sir. I prefer it over Euclidean coordinates.
AL HARRISON: Good. Then, I’m going to need it by the end of the day. And I’m also going to ask you to check Mr. Stafford’s math as well as others on this floor from time to time.
STAFFORD: I can work that out myself, Al.
AL HARRISON: I’m sure you can, Paul. I’m sure all of you can. But if that were the case, shingles wouldn’t be flying off the heat shield, now would they.
AL HARRISON: Excuse me. I just want to be clear about something...in 14 days the Mercury 7 will be here for training and I have no doubt that they’ll be asking questions about our work. Do I need to remind everyone...that we are putting a human on top of a missile and shooting him into space? It’s never been done before. And because it’s never been done...everything we do between now and then is going to matter- it’s going to matter to their wives, their kids, I believe it’s going to matter to the whole damn country.
AL HARRISON: So this Space Task Group will be as advertised. And Americas greatest engineering and scientific minds will not have a problem with having their work checked. Will they, Paul?
AL HARRISON: Good. So let’s have an amen, goddamnit.
THE ENTIRE SPACE TASK GROUP: Amen.
STAFFORD: My numbers are spot on.
KATHERINE: I’ll double check them, sir, not a problem.
KATHERINE: I’m not going to be able-
STAFFORD: Work on what you can read. The rest is classified. You don’t have clearance.
KATHERINE: Excuse me...
KATHERINE: May I ask you where the ladies’ room is?
RUTH: Sorry, I have no idea where your bathroom is.
AL HARRISON: Where’s that girl with those numbers?
RUTH: On a...break.
AL HARRISON: We take breaks now.
RUTH: My God, where have you been? Are you finished yet?
KATHERINE: I was- Almost. He said- the end of the day?
RUTH: The end of the day around here was yesterday.
AL HARRISON: I want those done first.
RUTH: He wants those done first. Get going.
KATHERINE: Mr. Harrison.
KATHERINE: Here you are, sir.
AL HARRISON: And Stafford’s heat shield calcs?
KATHERINE: It’s hard to be sure, sir.
AL HARRISON: Do you know what we’re doing here?
KATHERINE: We’re trying to put a man in space, sir.
AL HARRISON: That’s right. So you can throw that in the trash.
KATHERINE: Excuse me?
AL HARRISON: I said you can throw it away.
AL HARRISON: Here.
AL HARRISON: It's not an insult to your work.
AL HARRISON: It's just obsolete. That's how fast things are moving. If I said I was sorry, I'd be saying it all day.
AL HARRISON: What I’m asking you..what I’m asking everyone one in that room, all my geniuses, is to look beyond the numbers. To look around them. Through them. For answers to questions we don’t even know to ask. Math that doesn’t yet exist.
AL HARRISON: Because without it, we’re not going anywhere. We’re staying on the ground. We’re not flying into space...we’re not circling the earth. And we’re certainly not touching the moon. And in my mind...I’m already there.
AL HARRISON: Are you?
KATHERINE: Yes, sir
AL HARRISON: Good. Because I don’t need another smart girl with a calculator.
KATHERINE: Can I go, sir?
AL HARRISON: Oh. Yes. Yes. Go home.
KATHERINE: Good night, sir.
DOROTHY: We’ve been waiting for hours. Next time you catch a bus.
MARY: She’s in a mood.
DOROTHY: I haven’t been late one day in ten years. Haven’t been out sick. Haven’t complained. My work’s on time. It’s done right. It’s done well.
MARY: It’s not fair, that’s a fact.
DOROTHY: What’s not fair is having the responsibility of a Supervisor, but not the title or the money. Watching you all get moved on. Now don’t get me wrong, any upward movement is movement for us all. It just isn’t movement for me.
KATHERINE: Truth be told, Dorothy, I don’t know if I can keep up in that room. I’ll be back with the Computers in a week, or out of a job entirely.
DOROTHY: Oh, please. You’re better with the numbers than anyone in there and you know it. Make that pencil move as fast as your mind does, you’ll be fine.
DOROTHY: And you. Have some respect. Get your damn feet off my dash board. This isn’t your living room.
DOROTHY: I sound like a supervisor, don’t I?
MARY: A mean, ole salty one.
KATHERINE: Riddled with authority. No question.
DOROTHY: You don’t mess with, Mrs. Vaughan.
JOYLETTE COLEMAN: My word, Katherine. I was fixing to call the National Guard.
KATHERINE: Sorry, Momma. New assignment. The Space Task Group.
JOYLETTE COLEMAN: That sounds important. It’s a promotion?
KATHERINE: It’s important and overwhelming...maybe a slight promotion.
JOYLETTE COLEMAN: You want the job, right?
KATHERINE: I think so. It’s a challenge.
JOYLETTE COLEMAN: Nothing you can’t do, Katherine.
KATHERINE: Are they sleeping already?
JOYLETTE COLEMAN: They’re pretending to. They want their Momma.
KATHERINE: What are you doing?
CONSTANCE: It’s not fair Joylette always gets to sleep by herself ‘cause she’s the oldest.
JOYLETTE: It is too fair!
KATHY: Nuh unh!
KATHERINE: Constance, Kathy, come sit.
KATHERINE: I understand you want to be grown. And you want your own space. So I’m willing to change the rules--
JOYLETTE: Momma!
KATHERINE: Whoever sleeps in that bed in, Joylette’s place, will also dry the dishes, take out the trash, and do all the rest of Joylette’s choirs.
KATHY: That’s okay. Never mind.
CONSTANCE: She’s not so terrible to share with.
KATHERINE: Now don’t let me come home, find you like this again. You should have been asleep. A long time ago.
JOYLETTE: We just wanted to say “good night.”
KATHY: You’ve been gone for 300 hours.
KATHERINE: I work full time now. You all know that. I have to be the mommy and the daddy.
KATHERINE: I miss your father as much as anyone.
KATHY: He’s with his angels.
KATHERINE: That’s right. He’s with all his angels.
CONSTANCE: And he’s watching over us.
KATHERINE: Every minute.
KATHERINE: So, we’re going to be strong. We’re done crying about it. We have to all do our part now. Which means you have to go to bed like big girls. On your own. Understand?
ALL THREE SIBLINGS: Yes, Momma.
CONSTANCE: Are the Russians fixing to attack us?
KATHERINE: Where’d you hear that?
CONSTANCE: My teacher. She said they’re putting spies and nuclear bombs up in space.
JOYLETTE: We had to stay under our desks this morning. All scrunched up.
KATHERINE: That’s just a drill. A precaution. Truth is, we don’t know what they’re doing up there.
CONSTANCE: Are you going up to space too, Momma?
KATHERINE: No, baby. But I’m going to help those brave men do it. The best I can.
KATHY: You could fly to space too if you wanted to, Momma. You could be an astronaut.
KATHERINE: Thank you, baby. Now this time...really go to bed.
PASTOR AYRES: Praise God that change is coming. From the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, to the good Reverend Dr. King, to the students sitting in at lunch counters in North Carolina.
PASTOR AYRES: His faith in us has no limit! The good Lord has our very own women workin’ on rocket ships!
PASTOR AYRES: And we have National Guardsman defending our freedom!
PASTOR AYRES: Give a shout of praise for- Colonel Jim Johnson. Returning home by the grace of God, to set up a National Guard unit right here in Hampton!
PASTOR AYRES: Can I get a “Hallelujah” in here?
LEVI JACKSON: Now you want to be an engineer? A female engineer. We’re Negro, baby. Ain’t no such thing. Understand it.
MARY: It’s not like that there, Levi.
LEVI JACKSON: The only real chance we’re gonna have is when we fight back. You can’t “apply” for freedom. Freedom is never granted to the oppressed. It’s got to be demanded. Taken.
MARY: Levi, please. Stop quoting your slogans at me. I’ve heard them all. There’s more than one way to achieve something.
LEVI JR.: I don’t want any greens.
LEVI JACKSON: I tell you about interruptin’?
MARY: Try this, baby.
LEVI JACKSON: He’s gonna eat the greens too.
LEVI JACKSON: Kid needs to eat vegetables. You would know that, if you were home.
MARY: You better settle, Levi Jackson. Less you want this female’s mind right here, front of everybody.
LEVI JACKSON: All I’m saying, don’t play a fool. I don’t want to see you get hurt. NASA’s never given you gals your due, having another degree won’t change that. Civil rights ain’t always civil.
MARY: No lip, little miss. Your brother gets them, so do you.
DOROTHY: I hear he’s planning on staying in the area.
KATHERINE: That’s good for him.
MARY: Katherine, go find your way over there. That Colonel Jim’s a tall glass of water.
DOROTHY: That he is. Tall. Strong. Commanding.
MARY: Probably like that day...and night.
KATHERINE: Mary, it’s Sunday. Have some shame.
MARY: I will not.
DOROTHY: I think he’s smiling over here.
MARY: At you.
KATHERINE: I’m not smiling back.
DOROTHY: Yes, you are.
MARY: You’re all teeth right now.
KATHERINE: I am not.
DOROTHY: He’s coming this way.
KATHERINE: Why’s he doing that?
DOROTHY: Mary’s waving him over.
KATHERINE: Ladies, I don’t know if I’m-
MARY: Too late. Fix your hair on the side.
DOROTHY: Hello, Colonel. I’m Dorothy Vaughan. This is Mary Jackson. I believe you met her husband, Levi.
JIM JOHNSON: Yes, ma’am. Good to meet ya’ll.
DOROTHY: And this is Katherine Goble.
MARY: She’s not married. She’s a widow. With three little girls, so well-behaved. Angels on earth, we call ‘em. She can tell you the rest. Dorothy, slice-a pie?
DOROTHY: I’d love one.
JIM JOHNSON: Pastor mentioned you’re a “Computer” at NASA. What’s that entail?
KATHERINE: We calculate the mathematics necessary to enable launch and landing for the Space Program.
JIM JOHNSON: Aeronautics. Pretty heady stuff. They let women handle that kind of-
JIM JOHNSON: Well. That’s not what I mean.
KATHERINE: What do you mean?
JIM JOHNSON: I was just surprised something so...taxing-
KATHERINE: Mr. Johnson, it may be best if you quit talking right now.
JIM JOHNSON: I’m not meaning any disrespect-
KATHERINE: I’ll have you know, I was the first Negro female student at West Virginia University Graduate School. On any given day I analyze the manometer levels for air displacement, friction and velocity and compute over 10,000 calculations by cosine, square root and lately Analytic Geometry. By hand. There are 20 bright, highly capable Negro women in the West Computing Group. And we’re proud to be doing our part for the country.
KATHERINE: So, yes...they let women do some things over at NASA, Mr. Johnson. But it’s not because we wear skirts...it’s because we wear glasses.
DOROTHY: Alan Shepard. US Navy pilot. He could be the first man in space.
DOROTHY: DOROTHY All under 5’11”, 180 lbs. IQs over 130.
MARY: Handsome must be a requirement too.
KATHERINE: How can you possibly be ogling these white men?
MARY: It’s equal rights. I have the right to see fine in every color.
DOROTHY: That’s John Glenn. The only Marine Corps pilot.
DOROTHY: And those three there are Airforce- Gus Grissom, Gordon Cooper and Deke Slayton.
RUTH: Gentlemen, if we may...much to see around here.
JOHN GLENN: Heck, haven’t shaken all the hands yet.
RUTH: We have a fairly tight itinerary, Colonel.
AL HARRISON: Ruth-
DOROTHY: Sweet mother of mercy. They’re coming this way.
KATHERINE: Look straight ahead.
MARY: Shoot, look right at ‘em.
JOHN GLENN: Ladies. Didn’t wanna run off without saying hello. They seem to be in a big rush around here.
DOROTHY: The Russians certainly aren’t slowing down any.
JOHN GLENN: They can’t make a damn ‘frigerator, how the heck they beat us into space?
JOHN GLENN: What do you gals do for NASA?
KATHERINE: Calculate your trajectories, sir. Launch and landing.
JOHN GLENN: Can’t get anywhere without the numbers.
KATHERINE: No, sir.
MARY: Mary Jackson, Mr. Glenn. Engineering. Proud as the devil to be workin’ with you.
JOHN GLENN: Thank you, Mary.
REPORTER: Colonel Glenn, medical experts have stated that a man cannot survive in ZeroG. What are your feelings on the dangers of space flight? Are you scared at all?
JOHN GLENN: Well. I only discuss my ‘feelings’ with the Missus.
JOHN GLENN: I believe I can speak for all of us on this- we’ve been flying most of our lives.
JOHN GLENN: We’re honored to serve our country. That’s what we signed up for. We don’t think about the dangers or have the time to be scared, we have a job to do. Whatever happens up there is in God’s hands.
REPORTER: Well, which one of you wants to go first?
STAFFORD: Mr. Harrison wants you to confirm launch and landing for the Redstone Rocket test.
KATHERINE: I cannot work on what I cannot see, Mr. Stafford.
KATHERINE: It’s illegible.
STAFFORD: The numbers have been confirmed by two Engineers in this department, and myself. It’s more-or less a dummy check.
AL HARRISON: No one thought to measure this thing.
BILL CALHOUN: I’m afraid not. Should we stop?
AL HARRISON: No. No, just keep going.
VIVIAN MITCHELL: Our runner can pick up your work, Dorothy. You need to be workin’, not walkin’.
DOROTHY: It’s break time, ma’am. No trouble at all.
VIVIAN MITCHELL: Since you made the trip...you can take that batch over there.
DOROTHY: Sure thing, Mrs. Mitchell.
VIVIAN MITCHELL: You need somethin’ else?
DOROTHY: I was wondering if you knew what they’re building in the Tech Wing.
VIVIAN MITCHELL: It’s called an IBM. A mainframe machine. Apparently, it can do our calculations in a fraction-a the time.
DOROTHY: Guess that’s good for NASA.
VIVIAN MITCHELL: Hurry on, now. Best if you do it in one trip.
AL HARRISON: Whose work is that?
AL HARRISON: I said, whose work is that?
PAUL STAFFORD: How did you know the Redstone couldn’t support orbital flight?
PAUL STAFFORD: It’s classified information.
SAM TURNER: It’s top secret.
KATHERINE: It’s not a mystery why the Redstone tests keep failing. It’s fine for sub-orbital flight, but it can’t handle the weight of the capsule and push it into space. The numbers don’t lie.
AL HARRISON: And you figured that out with this? Half the data is redacted.
KATHERINE: What’s there tells the story if you read between the lines. The distance from launch to orbit is known. The Redstone mass is known. The Mercury Capsule weight is known. And the speeds are there in the data.
AL HARRISON: You did the math.
KATHERINE: Yes, sir. I looked beyond.
AL HARRISON: Then how did you know about the Atlas rocket? That’s not math. That data’s not here. Like he said, it’s classified.
KATHERINE: I held it up to the light.
AL HARRISON: Yep. There it is.
AL HARRISON: What’s your name?
KATHERINE: Katherine Goble.
AL HARRISON: Are you a spy, Katherine?
KATHERINE: Am I what?
AL HARRISON: Are you a Russian spy?
KATHERINE: No sir, I’m not Russian.
RUTH: She’s not Russian, sir.
AL HARRISON: All right then, we have nothing to lose here. Let’s get her everything she needs to work on Shepard’s trajectories. Without redaction. Are we clear on that?
PAUL STAFFORD: Are we sure about this?
AL HARRISON: What’s the issue, Paul? You heard her...she’s not a spy.
PAUL STAFFORD: I just don’t think it’s a good idea.
AL HARRISON: You know what I think is a good idea?
AL HARRISON: Darker ink. Ruth, think you could pass that along?
MARY: You can probably get to the moon and back with these.
KATHERINE: Just not the bathroom.
MARY: Least they’re not blind to what you do.
DOROTHY: It’s not going to matter soon. This IBM’s going to put us all out of work.
KATHERINE: What can we do about it?
DOROTHY: Only one thing to do- learn all we can. Make ourselves valuable. Somewhere down the line a human being’s going to have to hit the buttons.
KATHERINE: Oh, mercy.
MARY: Well, she must be lost.
VIVIAN MITCHELL: NASA doesn’t commission females for the Engineer Trainin’ Program.
MARY: That position is open to any qualified applicant.
VIVIAN MITCHELL: Right. ‘Cept you don’t have the educational requirements.
MARY: I have a Bachelors Degree in Mathematics and Physical Sciences. Same degree as most engineers ‘round here.
VIVIAN MITCHELL: We now require advanced extension courses through the University of Virginia. It’s in the Employee Handbook. An addendum.
VIVIAN MITCHELL: ‘Case you haven’t read it.
MARY: Every time we have a chance to get ahead, ya’ll move the finish line.
VIVIAN MITCHELL: I just follow the rules around here. And I expect those who work for me to follow ‘em as well. There are no special circumstances for anyone. Ya’ll should be thankful you have jobs at all.
MARY: “For those that cannot attend classes at the University of Virginia, Advanced Extension Courses are available at Hampton High School.”
KATHERINE: That’s still a segregated school.
MARY: Virginia acts like Brown vs. the Board of Ed. never happened. They’ll never just let a “colored” woman take classes at an all white school!
DOROTHY: Sounds about right.
MARY: That’s all you’re gonna say?
DOROTHY: I’m not going to sit here all day and listen to you complain about the way things are. Petition the court. Fight for what you want.
DOROTHY: But quit talking about it.
MARY: I’ve been complaining?
KATHERINE: For days.
DOROTHY: Not one more peep about work.
DOROTHY: Don’t give her any more.
KATHERINE: I can’t. She drank it all.
MARY: I’m fine. I’m as fine as I’ve ever been.
DOROTHY: You’re as drunk as you’ve ever been.
MARY: Damn. It’s my wedding song. Katherine, come dance with me.
KATHERINE: What? No.
MARY: Come on. Dance with me.
DOROTHY: Go on, Katherine. Go dance.
MARY: We have to teach you how to get a man!
KATHERINE: Teach me what!
KENNETH: What’s happening over there?
DOROTHY: Don’t pay attention to all that. We’re not part of that trouble.
DOROTHY: I told you no fussing around.
DOROTHY: Read together. Be quiet.
WHITE LIBRARIAN: We don’t want any trouble in here.
DOROTHY: I’m not here for any trouble.
WHITE LIBRARIAN: What are you here for?
DOROTHY: A book.
WHITE LIBRARIAN: You have books in the colored section.
DOROTHY: It doesn’t have what I’m looking for.
WHITE LIBRARIAN: That’s just the way it is.
DOROTHY: Get your hands off my boys. Don’t touch them.
DOROTHY: You have a blessed day.
DOROTHY: Separate and equal are two different things. Just cause it’s the way, doesn’t make it right. You understand?
THE BOYS: Yes, Momma.
DOROTHY: You act right, you are right. That’s for certain. Understand?
THE BOYS: Yes, Momma.
LEONARD: You took that book, Momma?
DOROTHY: Son, I pay taxes. And taxes pay for everything in that library. You can’t steal what you already paid for.
DOROTHY: Fortran is a new and exciting language used by programmers to communicate with computers...
DOROTHY: Cake’s already got sprinkles, baby. Doesn’t need a shower.
MARY: Look at that. What a surprise.
KATHERINE: I’ll say.
DOROTHY: Howard must have invited him.
KATHERINE: Mmm. Hmmm.
JIM JOHNSON: I believe I owe you an apology.
KATHERINE: Was that it?
JIM JOHNSON: Can I make it while we dance?
JIM JOHNSON: I’m afraid I simply misspoke, Mrs. Goble. I’ve been away for a long time. I imagine, I’m just out of practice.
KATHERINE: Mm-hmm.
JIM JOHNSON: And I was hoping you would allow me to start over?
KATHERINE: Mm-hmm.
JIM JOHNSON: The thing is...I have an interest in getting to know you better.
KATHERINE: Mm-hmm.
JIM JOHNSON: You are one tough customer.
KATHERINE: You haven't said “you’re sorry” yet.
JIM JOHNSON: Right. Of course. I’m sorry, Mrs. Goble.
KATHERINE: For what, Mr. Johnson?
JIM JOHNSON: Underestimating you. Or any woman like you. Though I can’t imagine there’s many.
KATHERINE: There you go. That’s good practice, right there.
RADIO ANNOUNCER: We interrupt Hampton’s Big Band Hour with breaking news. Russian cosmonaut, Yuri Gagarin, has become the first man in space.
RADIO ANNOUNCER: Gagarin completed one full orbit around the planet in one hundred and eight minutes.
RADIO ANNOUNCER: This is a crushing blow to America in the race for space.
JOHN GLENN: Well. They beat the pants off us. Now let’s go on, learn how to fly to space.
AL HARRISON: I want to thank everyone for staying. I know it’s late and after what we just saw, I think everyone’s probably anxious to go home. But before we do, I just have to ask... how can it be that we’re in second place in a two man race? Anybody? Paul?
AL HARRISON: Then I think Glenn said it pretty well. They’re just outworking us. And the reason I have to think that is because I refuse to believe that the Russians are smarter than us, or because they have more technology. Or that they care more. But I don’t know? Is that possible? Is it possible that it actually means more to them?
AL HARRISON: We’re in the fight of our lives, people. I just saw seven faces that don’t think we can get there. This isn’t some epic joyride that we’re all on together. So, as of right now, going forward, there’s only two things you need to know- one, staying late will be a fact of life.
AL HARRISON: And two- your paychecks will not reflect the extra time it takes to catch up and pass those bastards. For those of you that can’t work that way, I understand and thank you for what you've done. For everyone else, you can call your wives and tell them how it’s gonna be. I’ll start with mine.
STAFFORD: End of the day.
DOROTHY: Let’s see what you’re made of.
COURT CLERK: This is your court date. Colored seats are at the back of the courtroom.
DOROTHY: The IBM 7090 Data Processing System has the ability to solve problems that cannot be solved in a lifetime of manual labor. When working at optimal capacity it is capable of over 24,000 multiplications per second.
BERNIE: Holy Moses, that’s lightning fast.
ELEANOR: They’ll never get it to work.
DOROTHY: It’ll run eventually. We have to know how to program it once it does. Unless you’d rather be out of a job?
DOROTHY: Control console. Card reader. Card punch. Central Processor. Mother board...always a mother around somewhere.
MARY: Mr. Z.
MARY: I have a court date....
JIM JOHNSON: Heard you were fighting the flu.
JIM JOHNSON: Thought maybe you could use some soup? Hot meal for the girls.
AL HARRISON: Ruth, get the Cape on the line. Shepard’s trajectories need to be updated.
AL HARRISON: Where is she?
AL HARRISON: Where the hell have you been? Everywhere I look you're not where I need you to be. And it's not my imagination.
AL HARRISON: Where the hell do you go everyday?
KATHERINE: The bathroom, sir.
AL HARRISON: The bathroom! The damn bathroom!
KATHERINE: Yes, sir. The bathroom.
AL HARRISON: For 40 minutes a day? What do you do in there? We are T-minus zero here. I put a lot of faith in you.
KATHERINE: There’s no bathroom for me here.
AL HARRISON: There’s no bathroom? What do you mean there’s no bathroom for you here?
KATHERINE: There’s no bathroom here. There are no COLORED bathrooms in this building or ANY building outside the West Campus. Which is half a mile away! Did you know that? I have to walk to Timbuktu just to relieve myself! And I can’t take one of the handy bikes. Picture that, with my uniform- skirt below the knees and my heels. And don’t get me started about the “simple pearl necklace” I can’t afford. Lord knows you don’t pay “the coloreds enough for that. And I work like a dog day and night, living on coffee from a coffee pot half of you don’t want me to touch! So excuse me if I have to go to the restroom a few times a day!
AL HARRISON: Damn thing!
AL HARRISON: For Christ’s sake!
AL HARRISON: There you have it! No more colored restrooms. No more white restrooms. Just plain old toilets.
AL HARRISON: AL HARRISON At NASA we all...pee the same color!
JIM JOHNSON: I think it’s high time that I kissed you, Mrs. Goble.
KATHERINE: Oh. And why’s that?
JIM JOHNSON: Figure you’re attracted to me the same as I to you.
KATHERINE: Is that right?
JIM JOHNSON: Yes. Or you would have told me to get going a long time ago.
KATHERINE: Haven’t kissed a man in a long time. Almost forgot how.
TV REPORTER: We’re just moments away from Alan Shepard’s maiden flight as the first American in space.
ALAN SHEPARD: Any day now, Capcom. Fix your little problem and light this candle!
GORDON COOPER: Roger that, Freedom 7. Standby.
AL HARRISON: Move to final countdown sequence.
TV REPORTER: And we’re at T-minus 10, 9...
GORDON COOPER: 8, 7, 6...
GORDON COOPER: 5, 4, 3...
DOROTHY’S HOUSE FULL: 2, 1, 0.
GORDON COOPER: You’re go for launch.
TV REPORTER: And we have liftoff!
KATHERINE: Get up there. Go on.
ALAN SHEPARD: This is okay.
ALAN SHEPARD: Yaw is OK. Switching to manual roll.
JFK: For the eyes of the world now look into space, to the moon and to the planets beyond and we have vowed...
JFK: ...that we shall not see it governed by a hostile flag of conquest, but by a banner of freedom and peace.
JFK: We set sail on this new sea because there is new knowledge to be gained and new rights to be won...
JFK: ...and they must be won and used for the progress of all people.
PAUL STAFFORD: I imagine we should all thank President Kennedy for continued job security.
PAUL STAFFORD: Gus Grissom’s up next. Another suborbital flight with a Redstone.
PAUL STAFFORD: Our last shot before we strap Glenn to the Atlas and pray we can get him back down.
AL HARRISON: Yes, and I imagine he’d like us to have the math figured out beforehand. Good work, gentlemen. Go have dinner with your kids. Then let’s get back to work.
JFK: Yet the vows of this Nation can only be fulfilled if we in this Nation are first, and, therefore, we intend to be first.
DOROTHY: That’a girl.
BILL CALHOUN: What the hell are you doing?
BILL CALHOUN: You can’t be in here. Who are you?
DOROTHY: I’m with the West Computing Group. Dorothy Vaughan, sir.
BILL CALHOUN: This is a very delicate piece of equipment.
DOROTHY: I’m sorry, sir. Just trying to be helpful.
TECHNICIAN: Bill, we’ve got numbers.
BILL CALHOUN: What kind of numbers?
TECHNICIAN: Look.
WALTER CRONKITE: The mob of Klansman threw fire bombs at the bus, as it stopped in Anniston, AL. Fire and smoke trapped many of the Riders inside the vehicle.
WALTER CRONKITE: The local police stood by as the choking riders fled the flaming bus.
MARY: The kids don’t need to-
LEVI JACKSON: They need to see this. Everyone needs to see this.
LEVI JACKSON: Sit-ins will only get you so far.
A COURT CLERK: Mary Jackson. Petition to attend courses at Hampton High School.
MARY: Good morning, your honor.
THE JUDGE: Hampton High School is a white school, Mrs. Jackson.
MARY: Yes, your Honor. I’m aware of that.
THE JUDGE: Virginia is still a segregated state. Regardless of what the Federal Government says or the Supreme Court says. Our law is the law.
MARY: Your Honor, if I may, I believe there are special circumstances to be considered.
THE JUDGE: What would warrant a colored woman attendin’ a white school?
MARY: May I approach the bench, sir?
MARY: Your Honor, you of all people should understand the importance of being first.
THE JUDGE: How’s that, Mrs. Jackson?
MARY: You were the first in your family to serve in the Armed Forces. US Navy. The first to attend University. George Mason. And you are the first State Judge to be re-commissioned by three consecutive Governors.
THE JUDGE: You’ve done some research.
MARY: Yes, sir.
THE JUDGE: What’s the point here?
MARY: The point is, your Honor...
MARY: No Negro woman in the State of Virginia has ever attended an all white school. It’s unheard of.
THE JUDGE: Yes. It’s unheard of.
MARY: And before Alan Shepard sat on top of a rocket, no American had ever touched space.
MARY: He will forever be remembered as the Navy man from New Hampshire who was the first to touch the stars.
MARY: And I, sir, plan on being an engineer at NASA. But I can’t do that without taking those classes at that all-white high school. And I can’t change the color of my skin. So...I have no choice but to be the first. Which I can’t do without you.
MARY: Your Honor, of all the cases you’ll hear today, which one will matter in a hundred years? Which one will make you the “first?”
THE JUDGE: Only the night classes.
AL HARRISON: Ruth, send the tracking station coordinates to the briefing room.
KATHERINE: Mr. Stafford, Gus Grissom’s launch and landing coordinates.
KATHERINE: I’d like to get a jump on John Glenn’s trajectory.
PAUL STAFFORD: Do you have any idea what you’re asking?
KATHERINE: An orbital launch with an Atlas Rocket is going to take time.
AL HARRISON: Is there a problem?
KATHERINE: Mr. Harrison...I was wondering....
AL HARRISON: I’ve been wondering my whole life. Spit it out.
KATHERINE: Well, sir, I’d like to get a jump on John Glenn’s trajectory.
AL HARRISON: This isn’t about plugging in numbers, this is about inventing the math. I think we talked about that. It doesn’t exist.
KATHERINE: I can do it, sir.
PAUL STAFFORD: Do you know how exacting these calculations have to be?
KATHERINE: Yes. It’s like shooting a sawed-off shotgun from a thousand feet and getting that one beebee through a hole so tiny, you can’t even see it.
KATHERINE: I’m an excellent shot, sir.
AL HARRISON: How do Grissom’s numbers look good. Paul?
PAUL STAFFORD: They appear spot on.
AL HARRISON: Give Glenn’s orbit a go. But you run it all through Stafford. You understand?
KATHERINE: Yes, sir. Thank you.
PAUL STAFFORD: Computers don’t author reports.
NEWSCASTER: KATHERINE The hatch cover must have blown early.
NEWSCASTER: Wait. That’s him...in the waves. Gus Grissom is out of the capsule and floating in the middle of the ocean.
MARY: He blends right in.
PAUL STAFFORD: Don’t lose the damn capsule.
AL HARRISON: So, he’s swimming. He’s floating. Goddamnit, I don’t really care. Do we have a visual? Okay. Then where’s the other chopper?
NEWSCASTER: The helicopter cable has been cut. The Liberty Bell 7 capsule is lost.
DOROTHY: Get the man.
SENATOR PATRICK: Mr. Harrison, American Taxpayer money sank in the ocean along with your capsule. What makes you think you can bring John Glenn home safely?
AL HARRISON: Well, let me say first that discovery is never for the sake of discovery but for the sake of human survival, gentlemen, and it will always come with risk. Whoever gets there first, will make the rules.
AL HARRISON: That’s been true of every civilization. And so I think the bigger question for this body to consider is- who do you want calling the shots in space?
AL HARRISON: We have to know what’s out there, Senator. If only to ensure our own survival. We have to touch the stars. And only a man can do that. We’ll get John Glenn home safely because we have to, because he has to tell us what he saw.
PAUL STAFFORD: The Redstone Rocket- went straight up. The capsule didn't have enough speed to go into orbit. It came back down.
PAUL STAFFORD: Essentially it’s a triangle- Earth, suborbit, Earth. The math was known. It took Shepard, it took Grissom. It cannot take Glenn.
PAUL STAFFORD: The Atlas Rocket can push us into orbit. It goes up. Delivers the capsule into an elliptical orbit. Earth’s gravity keeps pulling it, but it’s going so fast that it keeps missing the Earth - that's how it stays in orbit.
PAUL STAFFORD: Getting it back down...that’s the math we don’t know.
KATHERINE: So...the capsule will spin around the Earth forever, because there’s nothing to slow it down?
PAUL STAFFORD: Yes. Slowing it down at precisely the right time, by precisely the right amount is the task.
KATHERINE: So...it has to move from an elliptical orbit to a parabolic orbit?
PAUL STAFFORD: Yes. That’s the Go/ No Go.
PAUL STAFFORD: This point is a pin head. We bring him in too soon...
SAM TURNER: He burns up on reentry.
PAUL STAFFORD: Too late...and he’s pushed out of Earth’s gravity.
KATHERINE: Any changes in mass, weight, speed, time, distance, friction...or a puff of wind...would alter the Go/No Go. And we would have to start calculating all over. Yes?
PAUL STAFFORD: Yes. We have to be able to choose this re-entry point. The Go/No Go has to be exact.
PAUL STAFFORD: These are the latest Redstone numbers and current capsule data. Obviously, we know the launch spot.
PAUL STAFFORD: The Pentagon Briefing should illuminate where the Navy needs the recovery zone. We work backwards from there. The rest is on us.
KATHERINE: Mr. Stafford.
KATHERINE: Sir. I if can attended these briefings, I would be more useful to the project.
STAFFORD: Pentagon briefings are closed door.
KATHERINE: Yes. But you know without the latest information, we can’t keep up. I need the changes as they occur. As you said, it’s a pin head.
STAFFORD: That’s the job, Katherine. You asked for the assignment. Calculate with what you have. Or we’ll find someone who can.
KATHERINE: Launch parameters for Friendship 7, sir.
PAUL STAFFORD: It’s all moot. We’re altering the window on the capsule.
KATHERINE: When did that happen?
PAUL STAFFORD: 6 minutes ago. The mass is changing. Start over.
KATHERINE: Sir. If I could attend these briefings...I’d be able to stay current-
PAUL STAFFORD: We’ve been through this, Katherine. It’s not possible. There’s no protocol for women attending.
KATHERINE: There’s no protocol for a man circling the Earth either, sir.
PAUL STAFFORD: That’s just the way it is.
KATHERINE: Colonel Glenn’s launch coordinates accounting for the window change, sir.
PAUL STAFFORD: I’ve told you this- Computers don’t author reports. Fix it.
KATHERINE: Those are my calculations. My name should be on it.
PAUL STAFFORD: That is not the way it works.
AL HARRISON: Paul. What’s happening here?
KATHERINE: Mr. Harrison, I’d like to attend today’s briefing.
AL HARRISON: Why’s that?
KATHERINE: Well, sir, the data changes so fast. The capsule changes. The weight and the landing zones are all changing daily. I do my work, you attend these briefings and I have to start all over. Colonel Glenn launches in a few weeks. And we don’t have the math figured out yet.
AL HARRISON: Why can’t she attend?
PAUL STAFFORD: She doesn’t have clearance, Al.
KATHERINE: I cannot do my work effectively without having all of the data and all of the information as soon as it’s available. I need to be in that room, hearing what you hear.
PAUL STAFFORD: Pentagon Briefings are not for civilians. It requires the highest clearance.
KATHERINE: I feel like I’m the best person to present my calculations, Mr. Harrison.
AL HARRISON: You’re not going to let this go. Are you?
KATHERINE: No, sir.
PAUL STAFFORD: And she’s a woman. There’s no protocol for a woman attending.
AL HARRISON: Okay, I get that part, Paul. But within these walls, who makes the rules?
KATHERINE: You, sir. You’re the boss.
KATHERINE: You just have to act like one.
AL HARRISON: You keep quiet.
KATHERINE: Thank you, sir.
AL HARRISON: This is Katherine Goble with our Trajectory and Launch Window Division. Her work is pertinent to today’s proceedings.
AL HARRISON: We have a confirmed launch window for Friendship 7. Let’s discuss a landing zone.
JIM WEBB: The Navy needs a singular landing zone.
NAVY OFFICER: 20 miles square is what we can service for retrieval. Outside of that, we risk the capsule’s recovery.
PAUL STAFFORD: We’d like 3 possible recovery areas.
NAVY OFFICER: We can’t cover half the damn ocean.
AL HARRISON: Our capsule’s being altered daily. And we’re orbiting the Earth at...what’s the speed now?
KATHERINE: 17,544 miles per hour.
KATHERINE: At the time the rocket delivers the capsule into low space orbit.
JOHN GLENN: That’s one hell of a speeding ticket.
JIM WEBB: So we have the capsule’s speed, launch window and for argument’s sake, let’s say the landing zone is The Bahamas...should be enough to figure the Go/No Go.
PAUL STAFFORD: In theory, sir.
JIM WEBB: We’re flinging a man around the globe at 17,000 miles per hour...we need to be past theory at this point.
AL HARRISON: We’ll be able to calculate a Go/No Go with that information.
JIM WEBB: When is that going to happen?
AL HARRISON: Katherine.
AL HARRISON: Have a go at it?
KATHERINE: The Go point for re-entry is 2,990 miles from where we want Colonel Glenn to land.
KATHERINE: If we assume that’s The Bahamas...
KATHERINE: At 17,544 miles per hour upon reentry...
KATHERINE: At a descent angle of 46.56 degrees...
KATHERINE: That puts the landing zone at...
KATHERINE: 25.0667° North, 77.3333° West.
KATHERINE: Right here. Give or take 20 square miles.
JOHN GLENN: I like her numbers.
JIM WEBB: That’s assuming the capsule hits the reentry point exactly. How do we insure that?
AL HARRISON: That’s the math we don’t have yet, gentlemen. We’re working on it.
AL HARRISON: What’s it gonna take to make this thing worth the price tag?
BILL CALHOUN: We’re just getting up to speed here, Mr. Harrison. I need more man power. Programmers. Folks to feed the cards.
AL HARRISON: Then get them, for crying out loud. You’re the IBM man. Pull them out of the sky if you have to, but let’s get ahead of this thing. Or I’m not paying you either.
DOROTHY: Me?
VIVIAN MITCHELL: Temporarily. Yes. We need the IBM for Glenn’s launch. The Lead Engineer says you’re good with the cards, programming and such.
DOROTHY: What about the girls here?
VIVIAN MITCHELL: Human computers can’t calculate an orbital flight in the time we have. They’ll stay put for now.
DOROTHY: What about after “now?”
VIVIAN MITCHELL: After the Glenn launch, NASA’s dissolvin’ the Computing Groups.
DOROTHY: I’m not accepting reassignment.
DOROTHY: Unless...I bring my ladies with me.
VIVIAN MITCHELL: Excuse me?
DOROTHY: We’re going to need a lot of manpower to program that beast. I can’t do it alone. My gals are ready. They can do the work.
DOROTHY: Ladies, we’ve been reassigned.
DOROTHY: Leave your calculators. You won’t need them where we’re going.
PAUL STAFFORD: Today’s heat shield test data, Al.
AL HARRISON: Do you know what your job is, Paul? To find the genius among those geniuses. To pull us all up. We all get to the peak together, or we don’t get there at all.
PAUL STAFFORD: Yes. Well. Good night, sir.
MARY: I don’t know when I’ll be home. The class ends at 9.
MARY: You have something to say?
LEVI JACKSON: Thought you might need these.
LEVI JACKSON: You can refill ‘em with any weight lead you want.
LEVI JACKSON: Just pull the eraser off, like this, drop the new lead down through here.
LEVI JACKSON: You’re going to make a fine engineer.
MARY: You think so?
LEVI JACKSON: Yes. Nobody dare stand in the way of Mary Jackson’s dreams. Myself included.
MARY: Amen.
MARY: Don’t make me mad again.
LEVI JACKSON: Yes, Ma’am.
MARY: Good evening. Is this Quantum Mechanics?
PROFESSOR: Yes.
MARY: I’m Mary Jackson. I’m enrolled.
PROFESSOR: Well. The curriculum is not designed for teaching...a woman.
MARY: Well, I imagine it’s the same as teaching a man. I don’t see a colored section. Should I take any seat?
KATHERINE: The problem is when the capsule moves from an elliptical orbit to a parabolic orbit. There’s no mathematical formula for that. We can calculate launch, landing, but without this conversion...the capsule stays in orbit, we can’t bring it home.
AL HARRISON: Maybe we’re thinking about this all wrong.
PAUL STAFFORD: How’s that?
AL HARRISON: Maybe it’s not new math at all.
KATHERINE: Maybe it’s old math. Something that looks at the problem numerically.
KATHERINE: And not theoretically. Math is always dependable.
AL HARRISON: For you it is.
KATHERINE: Euler’s Method.
PAUL STAFFORD: That’s ancient.
KATHERINE: Yes. But it works. It works numerically.
PAUL STAFFORD: Let’s type it up.
DOROTHY: Mrs. Mitchell.
VIVIAN MITCHELL: Dorothy.
DOROTHY: You’re working late tonight.
VIVIAN MITCHELL: Seems to always happen that way.
DOROTHY: Yes. Seems to.
VIVIAN MITCHELL: I hear the IBM is at full capacity.
DOROTHY: Appears so.
VIVIAN MITCHELL: You certainly have a knack for it.
DOROTHY: My father taught me a thing or two about mechanics.
VIVIAN MITCHELL: You know, I have a few girls in the East Group who have an interest in knowin’ more about it.
DOROTHY: It is the future.
VIVIAN MITCHELL: I may bring ‘em by, if it’s all the same to you.
DOROTHY: That’s not my decision. That would be the supervisor’s.
DOROTHY: Well. Good night, Mrs. Mitchell.
VIVIAN MITCHELL: You know, Dorothy...
VIVIAN MITCHELL: Despite what you may think...I have nothin’ against ya’ll.
DOROTHY: I know. I know you probably believe that.
KATHERINE: Please tell me I didn’t miss a birthday.
JIM JOHNSON: Good evening, Mrs. Goble.
KATHERINE: Jim.
CONSTANCE: Madame...your seat.
KATHERINE: Is it my birthday?
KATHERINE: Are you going to say anything?
JOYLETTE COLEMAN: It’s not my place.
KATHERINE: Okay, I’m not going to do this all night...
KATHERINE: Oh, mother of mercy. That’s for me.
KATHY: Are you sad, Momma?
JOYLETTE: It’s okay, Momma.
CONSTANCE: He’s a good man.
KATHERINE: I know. I know. I just. I can’t help it.
KATHY: He hasn’t even asked you yet.
KATHERINE: He’s going to.
KATHERINE: Is that what you’re going to do?
JIM JOHNSON: If anyone will let me.
CONSTANCE: Go on then. She’s already crying.
JIM JOHNSON: This was my mother’s ring. She and my father were married-
JOYLETTE: For 52 years.
JIM JOHNSON: I figure it’s about as lucky a ring as you can get.
JIM JOHNSON: The day I met you, I called my mother and asked her if I could have it. I said, “Mom, I met the woman I want to marry.”
KATHY: What’d she say?
JIM JOHNSON: She said, “She must be something, Jimmy. Really something.”
CONSTANCE: What did you say?
JIM JOHNSON: I said, “She’s not something. She’s everything.”
JIM JOHNSON: I planned on this being more romantic. I’ll make that up to you real soon. But I know marrying you...includes the girls as well.
JOYLETTE COLEMAN: Amen to that.
KATHERINE: I do.
JIM JOHNSON: I didn’t ask you yet.
KATHERINE: You wanted to see me, sir?
AL HARRISON: Have a seat.
KATHERINE: Something wrong, Mr. Harrison?
AL HARRISON: No. There’s nothing wrong. In fact our IBM is churning out numbers in fractions of the time any human can. Present company included.
KATHERINE: That’s good then.
AL HARRISON: Maybe. The thing is, the Cape is now insisting on doing all the backups down there. On site.
KATHERINE: I see.
AL HARRISON: So, we won’t be running backups here. And truth be told, we can’t keep up with that IBM anyhow.
AL HARRISON: Long story short, we no longer need a computer in this department. Progress is a double edged sword.
AL HARRISON: Let’s have you report back to the West Group for now. We’ll see if we can find another assignment.
KATHERINE: Thank you, sir.
AL HARRISON: I’m sorry about this, Katherine. It’s out of my hands, if you can believe it.
KATHERINE: I understand.
RUTH: Katherine...
RUTH: Heard you got engaged.
KATHERINE: Oh. Yes. That’s very thoughtful of you.
KATHERINE: They’re lovely.
RUTH: Mr. Harrison’s idea really. Beats the fake ones, that’s for certain.
RUTH: Although I suspect his wife did the picking out. I can’t imagine he has an eye for such things...
RUTH: Now you have a great wedding. You did good work around here.
KATHERINE: I don’t think I could feel a thing the first time I did this.
DOROTHY: You look even more beautiful than you did back then.
KATHERINE: You think so?
DOROTHY: Just a little older.
MARY: And a little fuller.
MARY: But you look good.
NEWSCASTER: #3 ...John Glenn, the first American to orbit the Earth. There are thousands of people here today...
AL HARRISON: These landing coordinates don’t match yesterday’s.
PAUL STAFFORD: The IBM just ran them.
AL HARRISON: Then the IBM was wrong yesterday. Or it’s wrong today.
SCOTT CARPENTER: The landing coordinates are off.
JOHN GLENN: What’s Langley saying?
SCOTT CARPENTER: They’re on the line.
AL HARRISON: The IBM has been spot on up to this point, John, but we’ll run it again, see what it comes up with.
JOHN GLENN: To be honest with you, Al...when I fly, I fly the machine and now I feel like the machines are flying me.
AL HARRISON: We’re on the same page. We’re staying on the ground until this works out our way. Stay tuned.
JOHN GLENN: Let’s get the girl to check the numbers.
AL HARRISON: The girl?
JOHN GLENN: Yes, sir. The smart one. If she says they’re good, I’m ready to go.
AL HARRISON: HARRISON Sam...go find Katherine. She needs to verify Glenn’s Go/No Go or we’re staying on the ground.
SAM: Yes, sir.
SAM TURNER: I’m looking for Katherine Goble?
KATHERINE: It’s Katherine Johnson now.
SAM TURNER: They need you to verify these.
DOROTHY: Alright, give her space. Let her work.
JOHN GLENN: Anything from Langley?
SCOTT CARPENTER: Not yet.
NEWSCASTER: T-minus 60 minutes. All the final tests and checks are being conducted. John Glenn is ready to board the Friendship 7.
KATHERINE: Recovery position- Longitude 21.347821.
KATHERINE: Latitude -69.643667.
MARY: What the devil are you doing? Taking a break?
KATHERINE: Here you go.
AL HARRISON: Katherine.
SAM TURNER: Sir, we’ve got Pad 14 at the Cape on the line.
AL HARRISON: This is Langley. We have the coordinates confirmed.
SCOTT CARPENTER: Langley’s on the phone.
JOHN GLENN: Right on time.
SCOTT CARPENTER: What do you say, Langley?
AL HARRISON: We can confirm the Go/No Go point for re-entry is 16.11984, -165.2356. The launch window is a go. The landing coordinates match.
JOHN GLENN: Good to hear that, Al. Hard to trust something you can’t look in the eyes.
AL HARRISON: That’s right, Colonel. Katherine did manage to calculate a few decimal points further than that hunk of metal.
JOHN GLENN: I’ll take every digit ya got. Be sure to thank her for me.
AL HARRISON: Copy that. Good luck, Friendship 7. We’ll see you in the Bahamas.
JOHN GLENN: God speed, Langley.
NEWSCASTER: T-minus 10 seconds. 9. 8.
MISSION CONTROL COMMANDER: 7. 6. 5.
MISSION CONTROL COMMANDER: 4. 3. 2. 1. Ignition. Go for liftoff.
JOHN GLENN: We’re programming into a roll.
MISSION CONTROL COMMANDER: Roger that.
JOHN GLENN: It’s getting bumpy along here.
JOHN GLENN: Roger that, smoothing out real fine.
MISSION CONTROL COMMANDER: Twenty seconds to SECO--
JOHN GLENN: Zero G. Feeling fine. I feel fine.
MISSION CONTROL COMMANDER: Go for SECO.
JOHN GLENN: Roger that.
JOHN GLENN: Oh, that view is tremendous.
MISSION CONTROL COMMANDER: Roger, that, Friendship 7. You are go for orbit.
AL HARRISON: 10.5 hours to go. If we make 7 round trips.
AL HARRISON: I need a coffee.
VIVIAN MITCHELL: New assignment came down the pike.
VIVIAN MITCHELL: Always changin’ ‘round here. Hard to keep up.
VIVIAN MITCHELL: Seems like they’re gonna need a permanent team to feed that IBM.
DOROTHY: How big of a team?
VIVIAN MITCHELL: 30 to start.
DOROTHY: Thank you for the information, Mrs. Mitchell.
VIVIAN MITCHELL: You’re quite welcome...Mrs. Vaughan.
JOHN GLENN: Capcom 7, I have a warning light.
MISSION CONTROL COMMANDER: Standby, Friendship 7.
ZIELINSKI: It’s the heat shield lock, Al.
AL HARRISON: What are we looking at, Stafford?
STAFFORD: The heat shield may have come loose.
MISSION CONTROL COMMANDER: 7, will you confirm the landing bag is in the OFF position?
JOHN GLENN: Affirmative, Capcom. Have you heard any banging noises or anything of this type at higher rates?
JOHN GLENN: That’s a negative.
STAFFORD: We need to get him down, now. We could burn up on re-entry.
AL HARRISON: Get Hawaii Capcom.
MARY: Gotta hurry, bunny rabbits. There’s a man in space. We don’t want to miss it.
MAN: Something’s wrong with Glenn.
NEWSCASTER: We’ve just learned, the Friendship 7 is in danger of losing its heat shield.
MARY: Tell them not to jettison the retropackage.
NEWSCASTER: NASA is confirming this is some sort of malfunction with the capsule’s heat shield and it may not stay in place. This doesn’t look good for John Glenn, America’s hero...is in danger.
AL HARRISON: Tell them not to jettison the retropackage. If the heat shield is loose, the retro-package straps might hold it in place.
PAUL STAFFORD: Hawaii. This is Langely...
PAUL STAFFORD: Oh, God. It’s got to work.
KATHERINE: It will work. The retro pack will hold it until the re-entry pressure secures the shield.
MARY: He has to override the 05g.
ZIELINSKI: He has to override the 05g.
MISSION CONTROL COMMANDER: Friendship 7, we’re recommending that the retro-package NOT, I say again, NOT be jettisoned. This means that you will have to override the 05g switch.
JOHN GLENN: Ah, Roger, that command. I’ll have to make a manual 05g entry, and bring the scope in.
AL HARRISON: He knows.
NEWSCASTER: Without a heat shield, there’s no way for John Glenn to get back through the Earth’s atmosphere.
MISSION CONTROL COMMANDER: You're going to use fly-by-wire for reentry. You’ll need to maintain a zero angle. Over.
JOHN GLENN: Ah, Roger. I'm on fly-by-wire, back-it up with manual. Over. Roger. The weather in the recovery area- 3-foot waves, 10 miles visibility.
JOHN GLENN: Roger. You're ground- --you are going out--
STAFFORD: He’s crossing the communication black-out zone.
AL HARRISON: Keep talking to him.
MISSION CONTROL COMMANDER: Seven, do you copy?
JOHN GLENN: I think the package just let go. Do you copy? There’s a real fireball outside and--
KATHERINE: Please, God.
MISSION CONTROL COMMANDER: Friendship 7. Do you copy? Over.
MISSION CONTROL COMMANDER: Friendship 7, do you copy? Over.
MISSION CONTROL COMMANDER: Friendship 7, do you copy? Over.
MISSION CONTROL COMMANDER: Friendship 7, do you copy? Over.
JOHN GLENN: Loud and clear, Capcom.
MISSION CONTROL COMMANDER: Roger that. How are you doing?
JOHN GLENN: My condition is good. But that was a real fireball, boy.
MISSION CONTROL COMMANDER: Roger that. Let’s get you all the way home.
JOHN GLENN: Roger. Here’s hoping these landing coords still hold.
MISSION CONTROL COMMANDER: Approaching 16.119.
JOHN GLENN: Roger.
MISSION CONTROL COMMANDER: Approaching -165.23. In 3, 2, 1.
JOHN GLENN: Engaging chutes.
JOHN GLENN: How do I look, Capcom?
MISSION CONTROL COMMANDER: Standby 7.
MISSION CONTROL COMMANDER: Your Go/No Go is good. Landing coordinates are spot on, 7.
JOHN GLENN: Roger that, Capcom. Always wanted to swim in the Bahamas. Over.
MISSION CONTROL COMMANDER: Friendship 7, we have you in our sights. The Navy is en route to recover.
RADIO ANNOUNCER: John Glenn has splashed-down and is being recovered.
MARY: Thank you, GOD!
VIVIAN MITCHELL: Girls. This is Mrs. Vaughan. Your supervisor. She’ll show you how things work.
DOROTHY: Ladies...better roll those sleeves up. This here is manual labor.
AL HARRISON: Nice work, Katherine.
KATHERINE: You too, Mr. Harrison.
AL HARRISON: You think we can get to the moon?
KATHERINE: We’re already there, sir.
