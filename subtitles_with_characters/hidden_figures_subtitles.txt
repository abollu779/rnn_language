00:00:59,124 --> 00:00:59,939
OTHER - Twenty-two.

8
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:03,723
OTHER - West Virginia Collegiate Institute is the
best school for Negros in the state.

9
00:01:04,687 --> 00:01:07,742
OTHER - It's the only school, past the eighth
grade, anywhere near here.

10
00:01:08,761 --> 00:01:11,796
KATHERINE - Isosceles. Scalene

11
00:01:12,115 --> 00:01:13,494

KATHERINE - Rhombus

13
00:01:15,797 --> 00:01:17,041
KATHERINE - Trapezoid

14
00:01:17,708 --> 00:01:19,116
OTHER - Katherine's in the sixth grade.

15
00:01:19,264 --> 00:01:20,612
OTHER - They want to take her early.

16
00:01:21,308 --> 00:01:22,560
KATHERINE - Tetrahedron,

17
00:01:23,722 --> 00:01:24,949
KATHERINE - Dodecahedron

18
00:01:25,574 --> 00:01:27,074
OTHER - They're offering a full scholarship.

19
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,821
OTHER - All you have to do is get there.

20
00:01:30,766 --> 00:01:32,001
OTHER - Ms. Coleman.

21
00:01:32,911 --> 00:01:35,574
OTHER - Why don't you solve the equation
on the board?

22
00:01:42,994 --> 00:01:45,453
OTHER - We took up a collection amongst the
teachers and such,

23
00:01:45,648 --> 00:01:47,061
OTHER - It's not a lot.

24
00:01:47,404 --> 00:01:49,331
OTHER - But it's enough to help get you
settle down

25
00:01:50,329 --> 00:01:52,494
OTHER - That's more than kind, Ms. Sumner.

26
00:02:04,438 --> 00:02:06,210
KATHERINE - If the product of two terms is zero,

27
00:02:07,212 --> 00:02:09,272
KATHERINE - then common sense says at least
one of the two terms

28
00:02:09,278 --> 00:02:10,633
KATHERINE - has to be zero to start with

29
00:02:11,475 --> 00:02:13,967
KATHERINE - So, if you move all the terms over
to one side,

30
00:02:14,369 --> 00:02:17,256
KATHERINE - you'd put the quadratics into a form
that can be factored,

31
00:02:18,167 --> 00:02:20,620
KATHERINE - Allowing that side of the equation
to equal zero.

32
00:02:21,764 --> 00:02:24,505
KATHERINE - Once you've done that,
it's pretty straight forward from there

33
00:02:27,429 --> 00:02:29,448
OTHER - In all my years of teaching,

34
00:02:29,828 --> 00:02:32,280
OTHER - I've never seen a mind like
the one your daughter has.

35
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,750
OTHER - Katherine!
OTHER - Hurry on now, love

36
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,690
OTHER - You have to go.

37
00:02:39,314 --> 00:02:40,914
OTHER - Let Mommy take you in.

38
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:50,029
OTHER - You have to see what she becomes.

39
00:03:16,117 --> 00:03:17,531
DOROTHY - Ok, try to turn it over, now!

40
00:03:19,055 --> 00:03:20,816
DOROTHY - Katherine?

41
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,605
DOROTHY - Mary!

42
00:03:22,606 --> 00:03:23,932
DOROTHY - Somebody!

43
00:03:23,933 --> 00:03:27,145
MARY - Katherine! Quit staring off into space
and turn the damn car over

44
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:29,076
KATHERINE - I got it.

45
00:03:30,093 --> 00:03:31,238
KATHERINE - I'm not deaf

46
00:03:31,303 --> 00:03:33,403
MARY - I wonder some times.

47
00:03:34,228 --> 00:03:35,670
KATHERINE - Here it goes.

48
00:03:37,935 --> 00:03:39,669
DOROTHY - Yeah, it's the starter.

49
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:41,977
DOROTHY - That is definitely the starter.

50
00:03:43,007 --> 00:03:44,690
MARY - The starter's startin' to make us late.

51
00:03:45,407 --> 00:03:49,192
MARY - We all go end up unemployed driving around
in this pile of junk to work everyday.

52
00:03:49,216 --> 00:03:51,234
DOROTHY - You're welcome to walk the 16 miles.

53
00:03:51,247 --> 00:03:52,464
KATHERINE - Or sit on the back of the bus.

54
00:03:54,294 --> 00:03:56,262
MARY - I won't do neither.

55
00:03:56,786 --> 00:03:58,386
MARY - I'll hitchhike.

56
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,206
MARY - Girls,

57
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,198
DOROTHY - No crime in a broken down car.

58
00:04:11,223 --> 00:04:13,310
MARY - No crime being Negro neither.

59
00:04:13,341 --> 00:04:17,450
KATHERINE - Button it up, Mary! Nobody wants to
go to jail behind your mouth.

60
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:19,129
MARY - I'll do my best, sugar.

61
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:34,851
OTHER - Not a great place for the three of
ya'll to be havin' car trouble.

62
00:04:35,161 --> 00:04:37,652
MARY - We didn't pick the place, Officer.
It picked us.

63
00:04:37,976 --> 00:04:39,676
OTHER - You bein' disrespectful?

64
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,051
MARY - No, sir.

65
00:04:41,052 --> 00:04:43,508
OTHER - You have identification on ya?
MARY - Yes, sir.

66
00:04:43,532 --> 00:04:45,532
MARY - Yes, sir.

67
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:47,860
KATHERINE - We're just on our way to work.

68
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,423
KATHERINE - At Langley.

69
00:04:50,658 --> 00:04:51,862
KATHERINE - NASA, sir.

70
00:04:51,887 --> 00:04:53,390
DOROTHY - We do a great deal of the calculating

71
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:55,367
DOROTHY - Getting our rockets into space.

72
00:04:55,761 --> 00:04:57,118
OTHER - All three?
KATHERINE - Yes, sir.

73
00:04:57,423 --> 00:04:58,447
MARY - Yes, officer.

74
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:02,403
OTHER - NASA, that's somethin'

75
00:05:03,207 --> 00:05:04,828
OTHER - I had no idea they hired...

76
00:05:05,582 --> 00:05:07,062
DOROTHY - There're quite a few women,

77
00:05:07,633 --> 00:05:09,141
DOROTHY - working in the Space Program.

78
00:05:18,168 --> 00:05:20,100
OTHER - Damn Russians are watching us right now.

79
00:05:20,824 --> 00:05:22,545
OTHER - Sputniks.

80
00:05:23,561 --> 00:05:25,219
OTHER - You girls ever meet those Astronauts?

81
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,596
OTHER - The Mercury 7?

82
00:05:27,234 --> 00:05:28,467
MARY - Absolutely

83
00:05:29,292 --> 00:05:32,905
KATHERINE - Yes, sir.
We work with those gentlemen all the time.

84
00:05:32,929 --> 00:05:34,278
OTHER - Those boys are the best we got.

85
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:36,203
OTHER - I'm sure of that
KATHERINE - Yeah

86
00:05:36,228 --> 00:05:38,450
OTHER - We gotta get a man up there
before the Commies do.

87
00:05:38,506 --> 00:05:39,555
KATHERINE - Yes!
MARY - Absolutely.

88
00:05:39,579 --> 00:05:41,151
OTHER - Whole damn country's counting on em.

89
00:05:41,152 --> 00:05:42,384
DOROTHY - That's for certain

90
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:45,240
MARY - Hard to be of service broken down on
the side of the road, though.

91
00:05:46,011 --> 00:05:47,138
OTHER - Right! Right!

92
00:05:47,824 --> 00:05:49,650
OTHER - Well, you need a tow or somethin'?

93
00:05:49,651 --> 00:05:52,257
DOROTHY - No, thank you, Officer.
I think I got it, Just give me that..

94
00:05:52,634 --> 00:05:53,689
OTHER - Just need to

95
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:55,703
DOROTHY - bypass the starter

96
00:05:58,261 --> 00:05:59,640
KATHERINE - She is good at this stuff

97
00:06:02,261 --> 00:06:04,160
DOROTHY - That a girl

98
00:06:04,161 --> 00:06:05,225
DOROTHY - We're all set.

99
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,642
OTHER - Hell. Least I can do is give ya
an escort.

100
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,570
OTHER - Imagine ya'll are
running late to work.

101
00:06:09,595 --> 00:06:11,305
KATHERINE - Oh, no sir! We wouldn't
want to bother you.

102
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:13,329
MARY - That would be wonderful, Officer.

103
00:06:13,935 --> 00:06:15,145
MARY - Thank you so much, sir.

104
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,159

105
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,259

107
00:06:28,195 --> 00:06:29,055
MARY - Yes!

108
00:06:29,065 --> 00:06:32,170
DOROTHY - Mary! Slow down! You're so close!
MARY - Well, be quiet. He said to follow him!

109
00:06:32,194 --> 00:06:33,799
DOROTHY - He didn't mean you hit him behind!

110
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,135
KATHERINE - Dear Lord..
I don't even know where to begin!

111
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,705
MARY - Oh! I'll tell you where to begin!

112
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:42,945
MARY - Three negro women are chasing
a white police officer

113
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:44,600
MARY - down the highway in Hampton, Virginia

114
00:06:45,245 --> 00:06:47,070
MARY - 1961.

115
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,700
MARY - Ladies, that there is
a God ordained miracle!

116
00:06:51,855 --> 00:06:56,485
KATHERINE - Starting tomorrow,
I'm riding the bus

117
00:07:19,548 --> 00:07:21,548
AL HARRISON - Show me

118
00:07:22,473 --> 00:07:24,483
AL HARRISON - No, exactly

119
00:07:31,152 --> 00:07:33,756
OTHER - Ascent angle: 46.56.

120
00:07:33,856 --> 00:07:38,151
OTHER - Approaching 7400 mph

121
00:07:38,251 --> 00:07:39,969
OTHER - 118 seconds.

122
00:07:49,409 --> 00:07:51,338
OTHER - Second stage. Success.

123
00:07:53,299 --> 00:07:56,727
OTHER - Korabl-Sputnik-4 is orbital.

124
00:07:57,567 --> 00:07:59,252
OTHER - Orbital entry is established.

125
00:07:59,945 --> 00:08:01,944
OTHER - Russian orbital entry is established.

126
00:08:03,845 --> 00:08:04,944
AL HARRISON - Jim Webb.

127
00:08:06,345 --> 00:08:08,044
AL HARRISON - Yes, Mr. President

128
00:08:08,645 --> 00:08:10,675
OTHER - We certainly are, sir.

129
00:08:11,305 --> 00:08:14,775
OTHER - It looks like they've achieved at least
one orbit, maybe two

130
00:08:16,743 --> 00:08:21,643
OTHER - Zvezdochka is ready to go again.
So is our comrade, Ivan.

131
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:23,510
OTHER - A brave space traveler.

132
00:08:23,943 --> 00:08:26,743
OTHER - We have proven life can be sustained
in space.

133
00:08:26,868 --> 00:08:28,768
OTHER - Now, we will be first to send a human

134
00:08:28,793 --> 00:08:30,456
OTHER - A damn dog!

135
00:08:30,637 --> 00:08:31,858
OTHER - And a damn mannequin!

136
00:08:35,367 --> 00:08:39,866
OTHER - And then a 1.6 megaton
RDS-37 thermonuclear warhead

137
00:08:39,891 --> 00:08:42,297
OTHER - drops down in the
middle of Des Moines.

138
00:08:42,436 --> 00:08:43,929
PAUL STAFFORD - Well, that's a pretty big jump, sir.

139
00:08:43,953 --> 00:08:44,953
AL HARRISON - What?

140
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:46,799
PAUL STAFFORD - Just there's that..
OTHER - Who the hell is he?

141
00:08:47,589 --> 00:08:49,708
AL HARRISON - Paul Stafford.
Our Lead Engineer, Mr. Webb.

142
00:08:49,717 --> 00:08:52,479
AL HARRISON - I think what he meant to say
is that speculation, at least

143
00:08:52,504 --> 00:08:55,114
AL HARRISON - on our side of the equation
by definition, can be..

144
00:08:55,843 --> 00:08:57,498
AL HARRISON - Just a little dangerous.

145
00:08:57,622 --> 00:08:58,713
AL HARRISON - Dangerous?

146
00:08:58,914 --> 00:09:00,721
OTHER - You know what's dangerous,
Mr. Stafford?

147
00:09:01,396 --> 00:09:03,298
OTHER - Inaction, and indecision.

148
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:06,712
OTHER - Russians have a spy
satellite lapping the planet,

149
00:09:06,737 --> 00:09:09,449
OTHER - taking pictures
of God knows what!

150
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,931
OTHER - The President is demanding
an immediate response.

151
00:09:13,051 --> 00:09:15,465
OTHER - No more delays.
Alan Shepard, John Glenn, your uncle Bob.

152
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:17,446
OTHER - Doesn't matter,
just get us up there, Harrison

153
00:09:17,499 --> 00:09:18,921
OTHER - We can't justify a space program

154
00:09:19,649 --> 00:09:21,236
OTHER - that doesn't put anything in space.

155
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:25,563
AL HARRISON - How did that feel in there, Paul?

156
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,735
AL HARRISON - Do you think you enlightened
the Administrator?

157
00:09:30,062 --> 00:09:31,593
AL HARRISON - No, he didn't look enlightened to me.

158
00:09:32,627 --> 00:09:35,627
AL HARRISON - He look enlightened to you, Sam?
OTHER - Not particularly.

159
00:09:35,755 --> 00:09:38,380
AL HARRISON - And just so you know, he's not
wrong about what he said in there.

160
00:09:38,405 --> 00:09:39,479
AL HARRISON - You know that, right?

161
00:09:40,074 --> 00:09:42,543
AL HARRISON - Because now that they can get up there,
a bomb will follow.

162
00:09:43,524 --> 00:09:45,390
AL HARRISON - That's what happens to all our good ideas.

163
00:09:46,427 --> 00:09:47,943
AL HARRISON - I imagine there is too

164
00:09:48,414 --> 00:09:49,755
AL HARRISON - Where's the machine?

165
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:51,657
RUTH - Any day now, Mr. Harrison.

166
00:09:51,681 --> 00:09:53,100
AL HARRISON - Any day now.
RUTH - Yes, sir.

167
00:09:53,501 --> 00:09:54,704
AL HARRISON - What's it called?

168
00:09:55,211 --> 00:09:56,803
AL HARRISON - The initials...
RUTH - The IBM.

169
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,511
PAUL STAFFORD - International business machine.

170
00:09:58,956 --> 00:10:00,341
AL HARRISON - Space is a business

171
00:10:01,994 --> 00:10:03,069
AL HARRISON - I need a mathematician.

172
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,018
RUTH - I'll put in another request, sir.
AL HARRISON - Another request.

173
00:10:06,019 --> 00:10:08,914
AL HARRISON - Jesus Christ! We don't have
a single person, in this entire building,

174
00:10:08,939 --> 00:10:10,874
AL HARRISON - that can handle Analytic Geometry?

175
00:10:10,898 --> 00:10:12,526
RUTH - That's what I've been told.

176
00:10:12,527 --> 00:10:15,013
AL HARRISON - Well, tell me something else, Ruth.
Like we're going to find such a person

177
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:17,530
AL HARRISON - before the Russians plant a flag
on the damn moon.

178
00:10:33,846 --> 00:10:35,145
DOROTHY - Ladies, ladies

179
00:10:35,146 --> 00:10:37,002
DOROTHY - If you're tardy, you don't
get an assignment

180
00:10:37,027 --> 00:10:39,364
DOROTHY - if you don't get an assignment
you don't have a job.

181
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,422
DOROTHY - Eleanor. Data Reduction, Building 202.

182
00:10:43,447 --> 00:10:44,496
DOROTHY - Data Reduction?

183
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,593
DOROTHY - Well. You're welcome to join the
charmers in Magneto-plasmadynamics.

184
00:10:47,617 --> 00:10:49,267
OTHER - Oh! No, ma'am.

185
00:10:49,368 --> 00:10:51,759
OTHER - Thank you, Data Reduction's just fine.

186
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:55,718
DOROTHY - Mary.
MARY - Present.

187
00:10:55,843 --> 00:10:58,498
DOROTHY - The Mercury 7 prototype
has arrived for testing.

188
00:10:58,532 --> 00:11:00,078
DOROTHY - Mr. Zielinski's requesting you.

189
00:11:01,179 --> 00:11:02,888
DOROTHY - For permanent assignment.

190
00:11:02,913 --> 00:11:04,756
MARY - Are you serious?
DOROTHY - Get moving.

191
00:11:07,093 --> 00:11:08,673
MARY - Oh! Thank you, Jesus!

192
00:11:09,318 --> 00:11:11,723
MARY - Thank you, Jesus! Oh! Thank you.
DOROTHY - Mary

193
00:11:12,447 --> 00:11:13,848
DOROTHY - Keep it inside

194
00:11:14,773 --> 00:11:16,473
MARY - I'm sorry, Dor

195
00:11:18,243 --> 00:11:19,637
DOROTHY - All right, Mrs. Late

196
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:21,552
DOROTHY - You'll also be..

197
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:24,340
DOROTHY - Mrs. Mitchell.

198
00:11:24,424 --> 00:11:26,541
VIVIAN MITCHELL - We're on double time this mornin', girls.

199
00:11:26,931 --> 00:11:28,533
VIVIAN MITCHELL - I need these calculations before lunch.

200
00:11:29,887 --> 00:11:32,702
VIVIAN MITCHELL - The Space Task Group needs a computer,
ASAP.

201
00:11:33,227 --> 00:11:34,960
VIVIAN MITCHELL - Someone with a handle on
Analytic Geometry.

202
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,250
VIVIAN MITCHELL - We can't fill the position outta
the East Group.

203
00:11:38,626 --> 00:11:39,921
DOROTHY - Permanent or temp?

204
00:11:39,924 --> 00:11:41,323
VIVIAN MITCHELL - Everything's temporary, Dorothy.

205
00:11:42,377 --> 00:11:44,597
VIVIAN MITCHELL - You have someone?
DOROTHY - Oh! Yes, ma'am.

206
00:11:44,998 --> 00:11:46,268
DOROTHY - Katherine's the gal for that.

207
00:11:47,133 --> 00:11:49,213
DOROTHY - She can handle any numbers you put
in front of her.

208
00:11:49,406 --> 00:11:51,058
VIVIAN MITCHELL - I'll check her credentials.

209
00:11:52,709 --> 00:11:55,198
VIVIAN MITCHELL - Didn't think of comin' all the way
down here.

210
00:11:55,322 --> 00:11:57,322
DOROTHY - Here.
Pinch press those out.

211
00:12:03,337 --> 00:12:04,445
DOROTHY - Mrs. Mitchell!

212
00:12:05,134 --> 00:12:06,179
DOROTHY - If I could.

213
00:12:07,554 --> 00:12:09,321
DOROTHY - My application for supervisor, ma'am.

214
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:12,979
DOROTHY - Was just wondering if they're still
considering me for that position.

215
00:12:13,403 --> 00:12:14,461
VIVIAN MITCHELL - Yes.

216
00:12:14,699 --> 00:12:16,025
VIVIAN MITCHELL - Well, the official word is: no.

217
00:12:17,366 --> 00:12:20,782
VIVIAN MITCHELL - They're not assignin' a permanent
supervisor for the Colored Group.

218
00:12:20,807 --> 00:12:22,145
DOROTHY - May I ask why?

219
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:23,825
VIVIAN MITCHELL - I don't know "why."

220
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:25,319
VIVIAN MITCHELL - I didn't ask "why."

221
00:12:25,343 --> 00:12:27,137
DOROTHY - We need a Supervisor, ma'am.

222
00:12:27,238 --> 00:12:30,503
DOROTHY - We haven't had one since Ms. Jansen got sick
It's been almost a year.

223
00:12:30,527 --> 00:12:32,228
VIVIAN MITCHELL - Things are workin' just fine as is.

224
00:12:32,429 --> 00:12:34,808
DOROTHY - I'm doing the work of a Supervisor.

225
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:38,181
VIVIAN MITCHELL - Well.
That's NASA, for ya.

226
00:12:38,829 --> 00:12:40,961
VIVIAN MITCHELL - Fast with rocket ships.
Slow with advancement.

227
00:12:42,103 --> 00:12:43,863
VIVIAN MITCHELL - Get those trajectories calcs worked out.

228
00:12:43,988 --> 00:12:45,519
VIVIAN MITCHELL - We need em for the Redstone test.

229
00:13:19,065 --> 00:13:21,065
OTHER - Mach 1 tunnel test, T-1 minute.

230
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,175
OTHER - No shoe is worth your life

231
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:37,900
OTHER - One.. One moment!

232
00:14:12,575 --> 00:14:13,770
OTHER - Shut it down.

233
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:22,460
OTHER - If we alter the exterior from smooth

234
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:26,554
OTHER - to corrugated, the capsule might
have more stability,

235
00:14:27,322 --> 00:14:29,874
MARY - But the friction,
it's under during reentry..

236
00:14:30,338 --> 00:14:33,317
OTHER - Most shield erosion occurs

237
00:14:33,991 --> 00:14:37,414
OTHER - on the posterior side abutting
the retro-boosters.

238
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:38,633
OTHER - Conclusion?

239
00:14:41,764 --> 00:14:44,358
MARY - The area closest to the boosters
is closest to the heat.

240
00:14:45,863 --> 00:14:47,717
MARY - Coupled with rising temperatures
on reentry,

241
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,318
MARY - the contacts soften.

242
00:14:50,645 --> 00:14:54,436
MARY - We could consider another fastener
other than bolts.

243
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,560
OTHER - Yes

244
00:14:58,671 --> 00:14:59,730
OTHER - Yes.

245
00:15:05,698 --> 00:15:08,271
OTHER - There's another opening in
the Engineer Training Program.

246
00:15:09,779 --> 00:15:12,239
MARY - Flat head rivets would reduce wind drag.

247
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,076
OTHER - Mary! A person with an engineer's
mind should be an engineer.

248
00:15:16,077 --> 00:15:18,608
OTHER - You can't be a Computer
the rest of your life.

249
00:15:18,633 --> 00:15:19,728
MARY - Mr. Zielinski.

250
00:15:20,301 --> 00:15:21,782
MARY - I'm a Negro woman.

251
00:15:22,382 --> 00:15:24,191
MARY - I'm not gonna to entertain the impossible

252
00:15:24,418 --> 00:15:27,604
OTHER - And I'm a polish Jew whose parents
died in a Nazi prison camp.

253
00:15:28,084 --> 00:15:30,316
OTHER - Now I'm standing beneath a space ship,

254
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,930
OTHER - that's going to carry an astronaut
to the stars.

255
00:15:34,054 --> 00:15:37,374
OTHER - I think we can say,
we are living the impossible.

256
00:15:38,509 --> 00:15:39,540
OTHER - Let me ask you..

257
00:15:39,743 --> 00:15:41,432
OTHER - If you were a white male,

258
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,830
OTHER - Would you wish to be an engineer?

259
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:47,125
MARY - I wouldn't have to.
I'd already be one.

260
00:15:48,756 --> 00:15:50,461
VIVIAN MITCHELL - Skirts must be worn past the knee.

261
00:15:50,486 --> 00:15:52,190
VIVIAN MITCHELL - Sweaters are preferred to blouses.

262
00:15:52,364 --> 00:15:53,399
VIVIAN MITCHELL - No jewelry.

263
00:15:53,886 --> 00:15:55,531
VIVIAN MITCHELL - A simple pearl necklace is the exception.

264
00:15:56,531 --> 00:15:59,024
VIVIAN MITCHELL - Your supervisor is Mr. Al Harrison.

265
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,614
VIVIAN MITCHELL - Director of the Space Task Group.

266
00:16:01,691 --> 00:16:04,408
VIVIAN MITCHELL - You'll write research,
proof calculations, so forth.

267
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:07,674
VIVIAN MITCHELL - Don't talk to Mr. Harrison lest
he talks to you.

268
00:16:08,755 --> 00:16:10,786
VIVIAN MITCHELL - Not many Computers last
more than a few days,

269
00:16:11,394 --> 00:16:13,313
VIVIAN MITCHELL - He's been through a dozen
in as many months.

270
00:16:14,152 --> 00:16:15,248
RUTH - Come on, keep up

271
00:16:15,773 --> 00:16:17,810
VIVIAN MITCHELL - Things move fast around here

272
00:16:18,578 --> 00:16:19,994
VIVIAN MITCHELL - Your clearance.

273
00:16:21,074 --> 00:16:23,374
VIVIAN MITCHELL - They've never had a colored in here before,
Katherine.

274
00:16:24,132 --> 00:16:25,233
VIVIAN MITCHELL - Don't embarrass me.

275
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,021
OTHER - This wasn't emptied last night.

276
00:16:53,046 --> 00:16:54,684
KATHERINE - I'm sorry. I'm not the..

277
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:56,650
KATHERINE - Custodian.

278
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:15,170
KATHERINE - Excuse me, ma'am.
Mr. Harrison's Computer reporting.

279
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:17,960
RUTH - Take the desk in the back.
I'll get your work in a..

280
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,020
RUTH - Bit.

281
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:24,100
RUTH - Mr. Harrison won't warm up to you,
don't expect it.

282
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:26,880
RUTH - Do your work, keep your head down.

283
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,610
KATHERINE - Thank you.

284
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,490
RUTH - Go on. Get settled.

285
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:43,060
AL HARRISON - Paul,

286
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,040
AL HARRISON - Why are we still losing shingles off
the heat shield?

287
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:49,208
PAUL STAFFORD - Well, We're working with a
prototype of the capsule, Al.

288
00:17:49,233 --> 00:17:51,744
PAUL STAFFORD - It's little as one third the size..
RUTH - I get that. So..

289
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,470
AL HARRISON - What do you do with our
million dollar fan, Karl?

290
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:57,824
AL HARRISON - Turn it down?
OTHER - No, I don't think...

291
00:17:57,849 --> 00:17:59,654
AL HARRISON - Hey! That was a joke.

292
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,880
AL HARRISON - Paul, if the heat shield comes off

293
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:04,818
AL HARRISON - what d'you think happens to our astronaut?

294
00:18:04,843 --> 00:18:05,685
AL HARRISON - I know.

295
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,260
AL HARRISON - So we're gonna..

296
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:09,187
AL HARRISON - We're gonna come up with a solve, right?

297
00:18:09,212 --> 00:18:10,714
PAUL STAFFORD - Yes, sir. We're working on it.

298
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,857
AL HARRISON - Ruth, what's the status on that Computer?

299
00:18:12,882 --> 00:18:14,574
RUTH - She's right behind you, Mr. Harrison.

300
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:21,780
KATHERINE - Does she handle Analytic Geometry?

301
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,270
RUTH - Absolutely. And she speaks.

302
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:26,830
PAUL STAFFORD - Yes, sir. I do.

303
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,220
AL HARRISON - Which one?
KATHERINE - Both.

304
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,160
KATHERINE - Geometry and speaking.

305
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:34,270
AL HARRISON - Ruth. Give me that.

306
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,140
AL HARRISON - Do you think you..

307
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,260
AL HARRISON - You think you can find me the Frenet frame
for this data,

308
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,402
AL HARRISON - Using the GramSchmidt...

309
00:18:44,427 --> 00:18:46,524
KATHERINE - With Orthogonalization algorithm.
Yes, sir.

310
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:49,190
KATHERINE - I prefer it over Euclidean coordinates.

311
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:53,690
AL HARRISON - OK. Good.

312
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:57,560
AL HARRISON - Good. Then, I'm going to need it
by the end of the day.

313
00:18:57,584 --> 00:18:58,529
KATHERINE - Yes.

314
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:01,029
AL HARRISON - I'm also going to ask you to check
Mr. Stafford's math

315
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:03,162
AL HARRISON - as well as others on this
floor from time to time.

316
00:19:03,187 --> 00:19:04,534
PAUL STAFFORD - I can.. I can handle that, Al.

317
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,830
AL HARRISON - I'm sure you can, Paul.
I'm sure they all can.

318
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:08,639
AL HARRISON - But if that were the case,

319
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:11,350
AL HARRISON - Shingles wouldn't be flying off the
heat shield now, would they?

320
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:15,720
AL HARRISON - Excuse me, could I have
everyone's attention for a moment?

321
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,500
AL HARRISON - Thank you. Just a..

322
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,590
AL HARRISON - Just to be clear..

323
00:19:21,815 --> 00:19:24,964
AL HARRISON - In 14 days the Mercury 7
will be here for training.

324
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:27,660
AL HARRISON - And I have no doubt in my mind
that they're going to be

325
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:30,000
AL HARRISON - asking us questions about our work.

326
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,650
AL HARRISON - I think that's a pretty reason
we're giving. We're putting a human..

327
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:35,633
AL HARRISON - On top of a missile and
shooting him into space

328
00:19:35,658 --> 00:19:37,634
AL HARRISON - And it's never been done before.

329
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,456
AL HARRISON - And because it's never been done.
Everything we do

330
00:19:40,581 --> 00:19:42,284
AL HARRISON - between now and
then is going to matter.

331
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:45,610
AL HARRISON - It's going to matter to their wives.

332
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:48,160
AL HARRISON - To their children.

333
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:51,500
AL HARRISON - I believe it's going to matter to
the whole damn country.

334
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:55,970
AL HARRISON - So this Space Task Group will be
as advertised.

335
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:59,060
AL HARRISON - America's greatest engineering
and scientific minds

336
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:01,610
KATHERINE - are not gonna have a problem

337
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:03,870
AL HARRISON - with having their work checked,
are they, Paul?

338
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:05,250
PAUL STAFFORD - No, sir.

339
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,080
AL HARRISON - Good. So let's have an amen, damnit

340
00:20:07,504 --> 00:20:09,079
OTHER - Amen.

341
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,780
OTHER - Amen.

342
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:13,110
AL HARRISON - All right!

343
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:42,660
PAUL STAFFORD - My numbers are spot on.

344
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,820
KATHERINE - I'll double check them, sir.
No problem.

345
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,240
KATHERINE - I'm not gonna be able to..
PAUL STAFFORD - Work on what you can read.

346
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:01,350
PAUL STAFFORD - The rest is classified.
You don't have clearance.

347
00:21:22,235 --> 00:21:23,335
KATHERINE - Excuse me...

348
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,960
KATHERINE - May I ask you where the ladies' room is?

349
00:21:24,961 --> 00:21:27,361
RUTH - Sorry, I have no idea where
your bathroom is?

350
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,510
RUTH - Yes, sir.

351
00:21:30,434 --> 00:21:31,534
RUTH - Ah! Yes.

352
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:58,167
AL HARRISON - Ruth!
KATHERINE - Yes, Mr. Harrison.

353
00:22:58,992 --> 00:23:00,784
AL HARRISON - Where's that girl with the numbers?

354
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:03,280
RUTH - On a... break.

355
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:06,310
AL HARRISON - We take breaks now?

356
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:36,260
RUTH - My God, where have you been?
Are you finished yet?

357
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:38,950
KATHERINE - Almost.
He said about the end of the day?

358
00:23:38,975 --> 00:23:41,534
RUTH - The end of the day around
here was yesterday.

359
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,589
AL HARRISON - I need those done first.

360
00:23:43,614 --> 00:23:44,930
RUTH - He wants those done first.

361
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,850
KATHERINE - OK!
RUTH - Get going.

362
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,900
KATHERINE - Mr. Harrison.

363
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:00,300
AL HARRISON - Oh! Yeah, just set up,
you know.

364
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,180
AL HARRISON - And Stafford's heat shield calcs?

365
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,930
KATHERINE - It's hard to be sure, sir.

366
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:11,130
KATHERINE - Hard to be sure.

367
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:14,080
AL HARRISON - You know what we're doing here?

368
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:17,030
KATHERINE - Trying to put a man into space, sir.

369
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:18,560
AL HARRISON - That's right.

370
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:21,770
AL HARRISON - That's right. So you can
throw that in the trash.

371
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,150
KATHERINE - Excuse me?

372
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:25,200
AL HARRISON - I said you can throw it away

373
00:25:26,155 --> 00:25:27,156
AL HARRISON - Here.

374
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,690
AL HARRISON - It's not an insult to your work.
It's just..

375
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:33,910
AL HARRISON - .. Obsolete.
That's how fast things are moving around here.

376
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:36,190
AL HARRISON - If I said I was sorry,
I'd be saying it all day.

377
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:40,380
AL HARRISON - What I'm asking you to do.. What I'm
asking everyone in that room,

378
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:44,030
AL HARRISON - all my... geniuses,
is to look beyond the numbers.

379
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,230
AL HARRISON - To look around them.

380
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:48,110
AL HARRISON - Through them.

381
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:51,530
AL HARRISON - For answers to questions we don't even
know to ask.

382
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:53,330
AL HARRISON - Math that doesn't yet exist.

383
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,800
AL HARRISON - Because without it,
we're not going anywhere.

384
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,150
AL HARRISON - I mean, we're staying on the ground.
We're not...

385
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,370
AL HARRISON - flying into space. We're not..

386
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:04,490
AL HARRISON - Circling the earth. And we're certainly
not touching the moon. And in my mind..

387
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:07,470
AL HARRISON - In my mind, I'm already there.

388
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,400
AL HARRISON - Are you?

389
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,310
KATHERINE - Yes, sir.

390
00:26:15,315 --> 00:26:16,415
AL HARRISON - Good.

391
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:19,500
AL HARRISON - Because I don't need another smart girl
with an adding machine.

392
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,880
KATHERINE - Can I go, sir?

393
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:28,690
AL HARRISON - Go? Yeah. Go, yeah.

394
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:31,330
KATHERINE - Yes, you can go

395
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:59,610
DOROTHY - I'm saying this is so much.
I'm not saying that.. I..

396
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:04,480
DOROTHY - We've been waiting for hours.

397
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,870
DOROTHY - Next time you take the bus.

398
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:07,600
MARY - She's in a mood.

399
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:30,050
DOROTHY - I haven't been late one day in ten years.
Haven't been out sick.

400
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,610
DOROTHY - Haven't complained. My work's on time.
It's done right. It's done well.

401
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,819
MARY - It's not fair, that's a fact.

402
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,473
DOROTHY - What's not fair is having
the responsibility of the Supervisor,

403
00:27:38,598 --> 00:27:41,054
DOROTHY - but not the title or the pay.

404
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:42,360
DOROTHY - Watching you two move on.

405
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:44,930
DOROTHY - Now don't get me wrong.

406
00:27:45,354 --> 00:27:47,454
DOROTHY - Any upward movement is movement for us all

407
00:27:49,278 --> 00:27:50,678
DOROTHY - It just isn't movement for me.

408
00:27:50,702 --> 00:27:55,002
KATHERINE - Truth be told, Dorothy, I don't really know
if I can keep up in that room.

409
00:27:55,426 --> 00:27:57,626
KATHERINE - I'll be back with the Computers in a week,

410
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,943
KATHERINE - or out of a job entirely.

411
00:27:59,968 --> 00:28:04,095
DOROTHY - Oh, please! You're better with the numbers
than anyone in the cabin and you know it.

412
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:07,260
DOROTHY - Make that pencil move as fast as
your mind does, you'll be fine.

413
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:11,355
DOROTHY - And you. Have some respect! Get
your damn feet off my dash board.

414
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,564
DOROTHY - This isn't your living room.

415
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,170
DOROTHY - I sound like a supervisor, don't I?

416
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:20,451
MARY - A mean, ole salty one.

417
00:28:20,676 --> 00:28:22,734
KATHERINE - Riddled with authority.
No question.

418
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:26,460
DOROTHY - You don't mess with, Mrs. Vaughan.

419
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:29,069
MARY - Turn that music up

420
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:47,150
OTHER - Goodnight, Katherine!
MARY - Bye, Kath!

421
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:49,675
KATHERINE - Goodnight, ladies!
See you in the morning.

422
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:00,670
OTHER - Hey baby
KATHERINE - Hello, mamma.

423
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:04,070
OTHER - I was fixing to call the National Guard.

424
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,720
KATHERINE - Sorry, Momma.

425
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:08,460
KATHERINE - New assignment.

426
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:10,490
KATHERINE - Space Task Group.

427
00:29:10,515 --> 00:29:12,814
OTHER - Oh my word, that sounds important

428
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:15,060
OTHER - It's a promotion?

429
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,710
KATHERINE - Might be a slight promotion.

430
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:20,500
OTHER - But you want the job, right?

431
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:23,260
KATHERINE - I think so.

432
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:24,780
KATHERINE - It's a challenge. But..

433
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:27,790
OTHER - Well, it's nothing you can't handle,
Katherine.

434
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,540
KATHERINE - Thank you, mamma.

435
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:35,930
KATHERINE - Are they asleep yet?
OTHER - They're pretending to be.

436
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:39,820
OTHER - They're not pretending well enough

437
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,170
KATHERINE - Thank you, mamma.
Love you.

438
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:45,810
KATHERINE - This is my bed!

439
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,650
KATHERINE - What are you doing?

440
00:29:49,674 --> 00:29:54,299
OTHER - It's not fair how Joylette gets to
sleep by herself cause she's the oldest.

441
00:29:54,323 --> 00:29:55,709
OTHER - Yes it is fair

442
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:59,150
KATHERINE - Constance, Kathy, sit.

443
00:30:04,005 --> 00:30:09,140
KATHERINE - Now, I understand you want to be grown.
And have your own space

444
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:11,550
KATHERINE - So whoever sleeps in that bed,

445
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:13,480
KATHERINE - in Joylette's place,

446
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,440
KATHERINE - will also do the dishes,

447
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:19,780
KATHERINE - take out the trash,
and do all of Joylette's chores

448
00:30:20,204 --> 00:30:21,904
OTHER - That's okay. Never mind.

449
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:25,260
OTHER - She's not so terrible to share with.

450
00:30:26,784 --> 00:30:27,884
KATHERINE - OK.

451
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:31,010
KATHERINE - Then don't let me come home and find you
like this again, you hear me?

452
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:33,960
KATHERINE - You're supposed to been asleep,
a long time ago.

453
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:35,600
OTHER - We just wanted to say goodnight.

454
00:30:35,924 --> 00:30:38,624
OTHER - You've been gone for 300 hours.

455
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:44,370
KATHERINE - I work a full-time job now. You all know that.

456
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:49,140
KATHERINE - I have to be mommy and daddy.

457
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:55,660
KATHERINE - I miss your father just as much as anyone

458
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,660
OTHER - He's with his angels.

459
00:30:58,384 --> 00:31:00,584
OTHER - Yes. He's with all his angels.

460
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:02,160
OTHER - And he's watching over us.

461
00:31:02,684 --> 00:31:04,994
KATHERINE - Every minute. OK?

462
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:08,560
KATHERINE - That's why we have to be strong.
All right?

463
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:11,700
OTHER - Yes, Mamma.
KATHERINE - Yeah get some rest, OK?

464
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,250
OTHER - Mamma?
KATHERINE - Yes, baby.

465
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:17,260
OTHER - Are the Russians fixing to attack us?

466
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:19,100
KATHERINE - Where'd you get that from?

467
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:22,080
OTHER - We had to hide under our desks today.
All scrunched up.

468
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:24,370
KATHERINE - OK, baby. That's called a drill.

469
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:26,620
KATHERINE - It means ..

470
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:30,780
KATHERINE - You practice safety, just in case
something happens.

471
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,930
KATHERINE - Truth is, we don't know what
they're doing up there.

472
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:40,640
OTHER - You're going up to space too?
KATHERINE - No, baby. But..

473
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:45,790
KATHERINE - I'm going to do what I can help those
brave men get there. Yes, I'm.

474
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,700
OTHER - You could fly up to space if you wanted to,
Mamma. You can be an astronaut.

475
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:53,360
KATHERINE - Did you draw this?
OTHER - Yes, mamma.

476
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,820
KATHERINE - Is that me?

477
00:31:58,070 --> 00:31:59,500
KATHERINE - You see this?

478
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:04,020

OTHER - Can I get a "Hallelujah" in here?!
OTHER - Hallelujah!

502
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:36,759
OTHER - I just don't understand..
I just.. I don't..

503
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:37,671
OTHER - I don't understand.

504
00:33:37,696 --> 00:33:39,744
OTHER - I don't want to talk
about this again, OK?

505
00:33:40,015 --> 00:33:41,815
OTHER - A female engineer?

506
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,480
OTHER - A female engineer.

507
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:46,660
OTHER - We're Negro, baby. Ain't no
such thing. Understand it.

508
00:33:46,684 --> 00:33:48,129
MARY - It's not like that there, Levi.

509
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:51,910
OTHER - You can't "apply" for freedom. Freedom
is never granted to the oppressed.

510
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:54,270
OTHER - It's got to be demanded. Taken.

511
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:56,410
MARY - Stop quoting your slogans at me.

512
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,820
MARY - There's more than one way to
achieve something.

513
00:33:58,830 --> 00:33:59,940
KATHERINE - I don't want any greens.

514
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:02,170
MARY - I tell you about interrupting?

515
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:04,070
MARY - Here, try this, baby.

516
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,500
OTHER - You gonna eat them greens too.

517
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:10,080
OTHER - Kids need to eat their vegetables.

518
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,850
KATHERINE - You'd know that if you was at home.

519
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:17,070
MARY - You better settle down, Levi Jackson.

520
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:21,300
MARY - Lest you want this female's mind
right here, in front of everybody.

521
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,130
KATHERINE - All I'm saying

522
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:26,480
KATHERINE - Don't play the fool.

523
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:28,410
OTHER - I don't want to see you get hurt.

524
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:30,683
OTHER - NASA's never ever given you gals your due,

525
00:34:30,708 --> 00:34:32,994
OTHER - having a couple of extra degrees
ain't gonna change that.

526
00:34:34,910 --> 00:34:36,870
OTHER - Civil rights ain't always civil.

527
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:44,410
OTHER - I don't want any greens either.

528
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:47,330
MARY - No lip, little miss. Your brother
gets them, and so do you.

529
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:52,000
DOROTHY - I hear he's planning on staying
in the area.

530
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:55,340
MARY - Well. That's good for him.

531
00:34:56,164 --> 00:34:58,470
MARY - Katherine,
go find your way over there.

532
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,890
MARY - That Colonel Jim is a tall glass of water

533
00:35:01,914 --> 00:35:05,714
DOROTHY - That he is.
Tall. Strong. Commanding.

534
00:35:05,738 --> 00:35:09,238
MARY - And I bet he's like that day and night.
DOROTHY - Mary

535
00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:12,490
KATHERINE - It's Sunday
Please, have some shame.

536
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,910
MARY - I will not.

537
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:18,190
DOROTHY - Mm. I think he's smiling over here.
MARY - At you

538
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:26,630
KATHERINE - I'm not smiling back.
MARY - You're all teeth right now.

539
00:35:26,654 --> 00:35:27,754
KATHERINE - I am not

540
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,600
DOROTHY - He's coming over
KATHERINE - Now, why would he be doing that?

541
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:35,210
DOROTHY - Because Mary's waving at him
DOROTHY - No! Ladies, I'm not..

542
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:36,820
MARY - Too late. Fix your hair on the side.

543
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,548
DOROTHY - I'm Dorothy Vaughan. That's Mary Jackson.
I believe you met her husband, Levi.

544
00:35:41,573 --> 00:35:43,110
JIM JOHNSON - Yes, ma'am. Good to meet you all.

545
00:35:43,111 --> 00:35:44,835
DOROTHY - And Ms. Katherine Goble.

546
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,650
MARY - She's not married. She's a widow.

547
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:49,050
MARY - With three beautiful little girls,

548
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,870
MARY - so well-behaved.
Angels on earth, is what we'd like to call 'em.

549
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:56,040
MARY - Dorothy, slice-a pie?
DOROTHY - I'd love one

550
00:35:56,264 --> 00:35:57,669
DOROTHY - Excuse me

551
00:35:57,870 --> 00:35:59,530
MARY - You already have a slice-a pie, Doro..

552
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:05,092
JIM JOHNSON - Well, I was just

553
00:36:05,117 --> 00:36:07,814
KATHERINE - fixing my three babies some plates.
JIM JOHNSON - May I help?

554
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:10,360
KATHERINE - Sure.
Ah! Fruit salad!

555
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:16,080
JIM JOHNSON - Pastor mentioned you're computer
at NASA

556
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:19,050
KATHERINE - Yes
JIM JOHNSON - What's that entail?

557
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:23,552
KATHERINE - We calculate the mathematics
necessary to enable

558
00:36:23,577 --> 00:36:25,644
KATHERINE - launch and landing for
the Space Program.

559
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:29,820
JIM JOHNSON - Pretty heady stuff!
KATHERINE - Yes, it is.

560
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:31,400
JIM JOHNSON - They let women handle that sort of..

561
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:36,760
JIM JOHNSON - That's.. Not what I mean

562
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:38,350
KATHERINE - What do you mean?

563
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:47,330
JIM JOHNSON - I am.. Just surprised something so..
Taxing

564
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:49,070
KATHERINE - Mr. Johnson

565
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:52,710
KATHERINE - If I were you, I'd quit talking right now

566
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:54,420
JIM JOHNSON - I don't mean any disrespect

567
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:58,199
KATHERINE - I'll have you know, I was
the first Negro female

568
00:36:58,224 --> 00:37:01,384
KATHERINE - student at West Virginia
University Graduate School.

569
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:05,077
KATHERINE - On any given day,
I analyze the manometer levels

570
00:37:05,102 --> 00:37:07,774
KATHERINE - for air displacement
friction and velocity.

571
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:11,686
KATHERINE - And compute over 10,000
calculations by cosine,

572
00:37:11,711 --> 00:37:14,664
KATHERINE - square root and lately
Analytic Geometry.

573
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:17,839
KATHERINE - By hand. There are 20 bright,

574
00:37:17,864 --> 00:37:20,574
KATHERINE - highly capable Negro women in the
West Computing Group,

575
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:23,560
KATHERINE - and we're proud to be doing our
part for the country.

576
00:37:24,361 --> 00:37:25,485
KATHERINE - So, yes

577
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:28,190
KATHERINE - They let women do some things at NASA,
Mr. Johnson.

578
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:30,000
KATHERINE - And it's not because we wear skirts

579
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,180
KATHERINE - It's because we wear glasses

580
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:35,650
KATHERINE  - Have a good day

581
00:37:50,015 --> 00:37:54,230
AL HARRISON - Scott, welcome to Langley.
Welcome to Langley.

582
00:37:54,554 --> 00:37:56,554
RUTH - Right here, Gentlemen

583
00:38:06,645 --> 00:38:08,645
DOROTHY - That's Alan Shepard.

584
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:11,560
DOROTHY - US Navy pilot. He could be
the first man in space.

585
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:14,570
DOROTHY - That's Scott Carpenter and
Walter Schirra.

586
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:15,810
DOROTHY - Also Navy pilots.

587
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:18,460
DOROTHY - All under 5'11", 180 lbs.

588
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:20,205
DOROTHY - IQs over 130.

589
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:23,004
MARY - And handsome must
be a requirement too.

590
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:25,682
KATHERINE - How could you possibly be
ogling these white men?

591
00:38:25,807 --> 00:38:29,044
MARY - It's equal rights. I have the
right to see fine in every color.

592
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:31,590
DOROTHY - That's John Glenn.

593
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:33,720
DOROTHY - He's the only Marine Corps pilot.

594
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,870
RUTH - Gentlemen, if we may..
Much to see around here.

595
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,930
JOHN GLENN - We haven't shaken all the hands yet.

596
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,752
RUTH - We have a fairly tight itinerary, Colonel.
MARY - Ruth, it's fine.

597
00:38:40,777 --> 00:38:42,890
KATHERINE - He's coming straight.
KATHERINE - Look around ahead.

598
00:38:43,015 --> 00:38:45,665
JOHN GLENN - Ladies. Didn't wanna
run off without saying hello

599
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:48,233
JOHN GLENN - They seem to be
in a big rush around here.

600
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:50,719
DOROTHY - The Russians certainly aren't
slowing down any.

601
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,419
JOHN GLENN - They can't build the refrigerator, how
the heck they beat us into space?

602
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,360
JOHN GLENN - What do you ladies do for NASA?

603
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,010
KATHERINE - Calculate your trajectories.
Launch and landing.

604
00:38:59,035 --> 00:39:01,244
JOHN GLENN - I can't get anywhere without the numbers.
KATHERINE - No, sir.

605
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:03,210
MARY - Mary Jackson, Mr. Glenn.

606
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,760
MARY - Engineering. And I'm proud as
the devil to be workin' with you.

607
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,190
JOHN GLENN - Thank you, Mary.

608
00:39:08,214 --> 00:39:09,669
AL HARRISON - John!

609
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:11,960
AL HARRISON - I must take it inside
JOHN GLENN - Yes, sir.

610
00:39:11,984 --> 00:39:13,589
AL HARRISON - Guys!

611
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:53,065
PAUL STAFFORD - Mr. Harrison wants you
to confirm launch

612
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:55,024
PAUL STAFFORD - and landing for the
Redstone Rocket test.

613
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:03,470
KATHERINE - I cannot work on what I cannot see,
Mr. Stafford.

614
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,199
KATHERINE - It's illegible.

615
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,982
PAUL STAFFORD - Those numbers have already been
confirmed by two engineers

616
00:40:07,007 --> 00:40:08,853
PAUL STAFFORD - in this department, and myself.

617
00:40:08,878 --> 00:40:11,014
PAUL STAFFORD - This is more or less
a dummy check.

618
00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:50,630
OTHER - This one, like make a two. Make
a double. OK? Get it?

619
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,050
AL HARRISON - No one thought to measure these things.

620
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:58,160
OTHER - I'm afraid, not. Sir.

621
00:40:59,570 --> 00:41:01,070
OTHER  - Would you like us to stop?

622
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,410
AL HARRISON - No. No, just..

623
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:06,240
AL HARRISON - I see, no. Just keep going.

624
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:08,890
AL HARRISON - In fact

625
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:11,410
AL HARRISON - Use.. Use the big hammer
OTHER - Yes, sir.

626
00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:14,160
OTHER - Come on, use the big hammer.
You heard the man. Let's go!

627
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:42,590
DOROTHY - Ma'am.

628
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:46,330
VIVIAN MITCHELL - Our runner can pick up your work, Dorothy.

629
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:49,460
VIVIAN MITCHELL - You need to be workin',
not walkin'.

630
00:41:49,490 --> 00:41:52,380
DOROTHY - Oh! It's break time, ma'am.
No trouble at all.

631
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,090
VIVIAN MITCHELL - Well, since you made the trip

632
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,300
VIVIAN MITCHELL - you can take that batch over there

633
00:41:57,430 --> 00:41:59,130
DOROTHY - Sure thing, Mrs. Mitchell.

634
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:03,698
VIVIAN MITCHELL - You need somethin' else?

635
00:42:03,723 --> 00:42:05,224
DOROTHY - Yes, ma'am.

636
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:08,370
DOROTHY - I was wondering if you knew what
they're building over in the Tech Wing.

637
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:12,890
VIVIAN MITCHELL - It's called an IBM.

638
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:14,260
VIVIAN MITCHELL - A mainframe machine.

639
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:18,210
VIVIAN MITCHELL - Apparently, it can do our calculations
in a fraction of the time.

640
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:21,870
DOROTHY - Guess that's good for NASA.

641
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:27,930
VIVIAN MITCHELL - Hurry on, now.
Best if you do it in one trip.

642
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:46,660
DOROTHY - Excuse me

643
00:43:31,095 --> 00:43:32,245
RUTH - Is that correct?

644
00:43:33,869 --> 00:43:35,169
PAUL STAFFORD - Yeah

645
00:43:41,945 --> 00:43:43,645
AL HARRISON - Whose work is that?

646
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:46,970
AL HARRISON - I said, whose work is that?!

647
00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:51,300
RUTH - Katherine Goble, sir.

648
00:43:56,430 --> 00:43:59,100
PAUL STAFFORD - How did you know the Redstone
couldn't support orbital flight?

649
00:43:59,124 --> 00:44:00,449
PAUL STAFFORD - That's classified information

650
00:44:00,450 --> 00:44:01,810
OTHER - It's top secret.

651
00:44:02,230 --> 00:44:04,729
KATHERINE - Well, it's no secret why the
Redstone test keep failing

652
00:44:04,730 --> 00:44:07,613
KATHERINE - its flight for sub-orbital flight,
but it can't handle the weight of the capsule

653
00:44:07,638 --> 00:44:09,304
KATHERINE - and push it into space.

654
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:11,770
KATHERINE - Numbers don't lie.

655
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,350
AL HARRISON - And you figured it all out with this?

656
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:17,360
AL HARRISON - Half the data is redacted

657
00:44:18,930 --> 00:44:22,030
KATHERINE - What's there tells the story
if you read between the lines.

658
00:44:22,470 --> 00:44:25,310
KATHERINE - The distance from launch to orbit, we know.
Then mass we know.

659
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:27,400
KATHERINE - The Mercury Capsule weight, we know.

660
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:30,080
KATHERINE - And the speeds are there.. In the data.

661
00:44:30,850 --> 00:44:32,060
AL HARRISON - You did the math.

662
00:44:32,684 --> 00:44:34,084
KATHERINE - Yes, sir.

663
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:35,910
KATHERINE - I looked beyond.

664
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:40,600
AL HARRISON - And how do you know about the
Atlas rocket?

665
00:44:43,690 --> 00:44:45,180
AL HARRISON - That's not math.

666
00:44:45,990 --> 00:44:48,710
AL HARRISON - That data's not here. Like he said,
it's classified.

667
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:56,440
KATHERINE - I held it up to the light.

668
00:44:57,330 --> 00:44:59,640
AL HARRISON - You held it up to the light?
KATHERINE - Yes, sir.

669
00:45:05,030 --> 00:45:06,620
AL HARRISON - Yep. There it is.

670
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:09,470
AL HARRISON - Atlas

671
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:11,490
AL HARRISON - What's your name?

672
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:13,240
KATHERINE - Katherine Goble.

673
00:45:14,490 --> 00:45:16,655
AL HARRISON - Are you a spy, Katherine?
KATHERINE - Am I what?

674
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:19,124
AL HARRISON - I'm saying, are you a Russian spy?
KATHERINE - No, sir.

675
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:20,980
KATHERINE - I'm not Russian.

676
00:45:22,710 --> 00:45:24,300
RUTH - She's not Russian, sir.

677
00:45:26,210 --> 00:45:28,067
AL HARRISON - All right then, we have
nothing to lose here.

678
00:45:28,092 --> 00:45:30,587
AL HARRISON - Give her everything she needs
to work on Shepard's trajectories.

679
00:45:30,612 --> 00:45:32,244
AL HARRISON - Without redaction.
Are we clear now?

680
00:45:32,290 --> 00:45:33,870
PAUL STAFFORD - Right.
Are we sure about this?

681
00:45:34,250 --> 00:45:35,790
AL HARRISON - What's the issue, Paul?
You heard her.

682
00:45:36,490 --> 00:45:37,700
AL HARRISON - She's not a spy.

683
00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:40,494
PAUL STAFFORD - I.. I just don't think it's a good idea.

684
00:45:40,719 --> 00:45:42,464
AL HARRISON - You know what I think is a good idea?

685
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,050
AL HARRISON - Darker ink.

686
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:46,970
AL HARRISON - I think darker ink is a good idea.
Ruth, could pass it along?

687
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:48,049
RUTH - Yes, sir.

688
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:50,060
AL HARRISON - Thank you, Katherine
KATHERINE - Thank you, sir.

689
00:45:57,010 --> 00:45:58,460
AL HARRISON - This interrogation is over

690
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,719
MARY - You can probably get to the
moon and back with this.

691
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:21,419
KATHERINE - Just not the bathroom.

692
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:23,025
MARY - At least they're not
blind to what you do.

693
00:46:23,050 --> 00:46:24,454
DOROTHY - It's not going to matter soon.

694
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:27,050
DOROTHY - This IBM's going to put us all out of work.

695
00:46:28,330 --> 00:46:29,670
KATHERINE - What can we do about it?

696
00:46:30,610 --> 00:46:31,800
DOROTHY - Only one thing to do

697
00:46:32,650 --> 00:46:34,500
DOROTHY - Learn all we can.
Make ourselves valuable.

698
00:46:35,010 --> 00:46:37,623
DOROTHY - Somewhere down the line a human being's
going to have to push the buttons.

699
00:46:37,648 --> 00:46:38,684
VIVIAN MITCHELL - That's right.

700
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:42,020
KATHERINE - Oh, mercy

701
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:44,208
MARY - Well, she must be lost.

702
00:46:44,233 --> 00:46:47,794
VIVIAN MITCHELL - NASA doesn't commission females
for the Engineer Training Program.

703
00:46:48,530 --> 00:46:52,210
MARY - That position is available to any
qualified applicant.

704
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:54,999
VIVIAN MITCHELL - Right. Except you don't have
the educational requirements.

705
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,750
MARY - I have a Bachelors Degree in
Mathematics and Physical Sciences.

706
00:46:57,775 --> 00:46:59,794
MARY - It's the same as most
engineers around here.

707
00:46:59,970 --> 00:47:04,163
VIVIAN MITCHELL - Well, we now require advanced extension
courses through the University of Virginia.

708
00:47:04,188 --> 00:47:06,804
VIVIAN MITCHELL - It's in the Employee Handbook.
An addendum.

709
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:08,650
VIVIAN MITCHELL - Case you haven't read it

710
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:12,740
MARY - Every time we have a chance to get
ahead, they move the finish line.

711
00:47:12,765 --> 00:47:15,083
VIVIAN MITCHELL - I just follow the rules around here.
And I expect..

712
00:47:15,108 --> 00:47:17,368
VIVIAN MITCHELL - Everyone who works for
me to follow them as well.

713
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:20,410
VIVIAN MITCHELL - There are no special circumstances
for anyone.

714
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:23,340
VIVIAN MITCHELL - You all should be thankful,
you have jobs at all.

715
00:47:29,190 --> 00:47:30,800
MARY - "For those that cannot attend classes

716
00:47:31,050 --> 00:47:32,910
MARY - at the University of Virginia,

717
00:47:32,970 --> 00:47:36,900
MARY - Advanced Extension Courses are
available at Hampton High School."

718
00:47:38,030 --> 00:47:39,760
KATHERINE - That's still a segregated school, Mary

719
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:43,870
MARY - Virginia acts like Brown vs. Board
of Education never happened.

720
00:47:43,890 --> 00:47:48,620
MARY - They'll never gonna allow a colored woman
just take classes at an all white school!

721
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:52,190
DOROTHY - Sounds about right.
MARY - That's all you're gonna say?

722
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:54,058
DOROTHY - Well, I'm not going to sit
here all day and listen to you

723
00:47:54,083 --> 00:47:56,364
DOROTHY - complain about the way things
are, we're tryin to play cards.

724
00:47:56,810 --> 00:47:59,590
DOROTHY - Petition the court. Fight for what
you want. But quit talking about it

725
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:04,800
MARY - I've been complaining?
KATHERINE - For days

726
00:48:04,824 --> 00:48:06,124
DOROTHY - Ladies

727
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:08,310
DOROTHY - Not one more peep about work.

728
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:10,270
MARY - Deal me in

729
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:12,370
MARY - Katherine,
come on

730
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:14,510
MARY - You

731
00:48:14,570 --> 00:48:17,070
MARY - Yeah! I needed this!
Thank you!

732
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,070
DOROTHY - Don't give her any more Katherine

733
00:48:22,370 --> 00:48:24,200
KATHERINE - I can't. She drank it all.

734
00:48:24,424 --> 00:48:26,424
MARY - Yes.
I'm fine

735
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:28,700
MARY - I'm as fine as I've ever been.

736
00:48:28,725 --> 00:48:31,224
DOROTHY - You're as drunk as you've ever been.

737
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:34,400
MARY - Come on! Let's dance, girls.

738
00:48:34,824 --> 00:48:37,124
MARY - Come on, Kath!
Let's dance.

739
00:48:37,148 --> 00:48:38,284
DOROTHY - Go dance, Katherine.

740
00:48:38,285 --> 00:48:40,784
MARY - Come on!

741
00:48:40,785 --> 00:48:42,052
KATHERINE - We're gonna teach you how

742
00:48:42,077 --> 00:48:47,354
MARY - Keep going, here! All right.
Slow! Here slow down.

743
00:49:09,554 --> 00:49:19,554
OTHER - Segregation must go!

744
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:24,880
DOROTHY - Don't pay attention to any of that. We're
not part of that trouble. Go on.

745
00:49:36,585 --> 00:49:37,585
OTHER - Leonard..

746
00:49:37,610 --> 00:49:39,270
OTHER - We must have done it.

747
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:45,555
OTHER - We don't want any trouble in here.

748
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:47,980
DOROTHY - Oh! I'm not here for any trouble. Ma'am.

749
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:49,450
OTHER - What are you here for?

750
00:49:50,630 --> 00:49:51,680
DOROTHY - A book.

751
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:54,260
OTHER - You have books in the colored section.

752
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:57,050
DOROTHY - It doesn't have what I'm looking for.

753
00:49:57,170 --> 00:49:58,950
OTHER - Well, that's just the way it is.

754
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:05,106
OTHER - Well, you know better...

755
00:50:05,107 --> 00:50:07,330
DOROTHY - Get your hands off my boys.
Don't touch them.

756
00:50:08,490 --> 00:50:09,730
DOROTHY - You have a blessed day.

757
00:50:18,955 --> 00:50:22,220
DOROTHY - Separate and equal are
two different things.

758
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:24,215
DOROTHY - Just cause it's the way
doesn't make it right.

759
00:50:25,165 --> 00:50:26,215
DOROTHY - Understand?

760
00:50:27,239 --> 00:50:28,239
OTHER - Yes, mamma.

761
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:33,155
DOROTHY - You act right, you are right.
That's for certain. Understand?

762
00:50:33,579 --> 00:50:34,879
OTHER - Yes, mamma.

763
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:42,150
OTHER - You took that book, mamma?

764
00:50:42,774 --> 00:50:44,774
DOROTHY - Son, I pay taxes.

765
00:50:44,815 --> 00:50:46,830
DOROTHY - And taxes pay for everything
in that library.

766
00:50:46,854 --> 00:50:48,854
DOROTHY - You can't take something
you've already paid for.

767
00:50:53,675 --> 00:50:56,515
DOROTHY - FORTRAN is a new and exciting language..

768
00:50:57,315 --> 00:51:00,325
DOROTHY - Used by programmers to communicate
with computers...

769
00:51:00,790 --> 00:51:04,285
DOROTHY - It's exciting, as it's the way
of the future.

770
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:06,545
OTHER - And everybody smile.

771
00:51:06,570 --> 00:51:08,010
OTHER - Everybody smile.

772
00:51:11,630 --> 00:51:14,000
OTHER - Make a wish!

773
00:51:17,170 --> 00:51:19,230
KATHERINE - Leonard, you need to get you a job now.

774
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:20,799
MARY - Two girls!

775
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:26,676
MARY - Well, look at that.
MARY - Look at what?

776
00:51:26,901 --> 00:51:28,220
MARY - What a surprise.

777
00:51:30,945 --> 00:51:32,345
KATHERINE - I'll say.

778
00:51:32,970 --> 00:51:34,940
DOROTHY - Howard must have invited him.
KATHERINE - Mmm. Hmmm.

779
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:37,000
DOROTHY - Let me go help him
with those flowers

780
00:52:12,770 --> 00:52:14,715
JIM JOHNSON - I believe I owe you an apology.

781
00:52:17,450 --> 00:52:19,300
KATHERINE - Well, is that it?

782
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,770
JIM JOHNSON - Can I make it while we dance?

783
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:36,490
JIM JOHNSON - I'm afraid I simply misspoke the other
day, Mrs. Goble.

784
00:52:39,130 --> 00:52:41,180
JIM JOHNSON - I've been away for a long time.

785
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:43,820
JIM JOHNSON - I imagine, I'm just out of practice.

786
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:46,780
KATHERINE - Mm-hmm.

787
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:49,410
JIM JOHNSON - Yeah. I was hoping you would allow me
to start over?

788
00:52:51,610 --> 00:52:52,673
KATHERINE - Mm-hmm.

789
00:52:52,698 --> 00:52:54,385
JIM JOHNSON - So, the thing is..

790
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:57,020
JIM JOHNSON - I have an interest in getting
to know you better.

791
00:52:57,660 --> 00:52:58,990
KATHERINE - Mm-hmm.

792
00:53:00,550 --> 00:53:02,450
JIM JOHNSON - You are one tough customer. Huh?

793
00:53:04,670 --> 00:53:06,200
KATHERINE - You haven't said you're sorry yet

794
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:08,710
JIM JOHNSON - Right.
Of course.

795
00:53:12,790 --> 00:53:14,010
JIM JOHNSON - I'm sorry, Katherine.

796
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:16,710
KATHERINE - For what, Jim?

797
00:53:17,470 --> 00:53:19,030
JIM JOHNSON - Underestimating you.

798
00:53:19,610 --> 00:53:21,290
JIM JOHNSON - And any other woman like you.

799
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:25,540
JIM JOHNSON - Though I don't imagine there's many.

800
00:53:27,990 --> 00:53:29,910
KATHERINE - That's good practice, right there.

801
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:35,150
OTHER - We interrupt this musical programming
with breaking news.

802
00:53:36,874 --> 00:53:40,174

that Russian cosmonaut,

803

804
00:53:43,610 --> 00:53:47,960
OTHER - Gagarin completed one full orbit around
the planet in 108 minutes.

805
00:53:48,090 --> 00:53:51,440
OTHER - Stay tuned to the station for more
details, as they become available.

806
00:53:51,664 --> 00:53:54,909
KATHERINE - Well,
I guess that puts us behind the curve.

807
00:53:55,210 --> 00:53:57,927
OTHER - The Vostok 1 rocket,
delivered Russian cosmonaut

808
00:53:57,952 --> 00:54:02,263

Proving conclusively

810

OTHER - that man could survive orbital space flight
Gagarin was awarded the Order of Lenin

811
00:54:12,821 --> 00:54:13,845
JOHN GLENN - Well..

812
00:54:13,870 --> 00:54:16,080
JOHN GLENN - They beat the pants off us.
Let's go..

813
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:18,990
JOHN GLENN - Just learn how to fly to space.

814
00:54:21,250 --> 00:54:23,500
OTHER - And has been proclaimed a national hero.

815
00:54:24,424 --> 00:54:28,924
OTHER - This is a day of unprecedented triumph
for the Russian space program,

816
00:54:29,248 --> 00:54:32,748
OTHER - And a crushing blow for America
in the race for space.

817
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:34,930
AL HARRISON - I want to thank everyone for staying.

818
00:54:36,370 --> 00:54:38,840
AL HARRISON - I know it's late, and
after what we just saw

819
00:54:38,865 --> 00:54:41,544
AL HARRISON - I'm sure everyone's
probably anxious to go home.

820
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:44,350
AL HARRISON - But before we do, I just have
to ask the question

821
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:46,870
AL HARRISON - The same one

822
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:50,160
AL HARRISON - I've been asking myself all the way
over here, which is

823
00:54:52,870 --> 00:54:56,330
AL HARRISON - How the hell did we find ourselves
in second place in a two men race?

824
00:54:57,230 --> 00:54:58,280
AL HARRISON - Anybody?

825
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:00,410
AL HARRISON - Paul?

826
00:55:01,620 --> 00:55:04,230
AL HARRISON - I think Glenn said it pretty well.
They're just outworking us.

827
00:55:04,254 --> 00:55:05,889
AL HARRISON - And the reason I have to..

828
00:55:06,090 --> 00:55:09,400
AL HARRISON - Think that is because I refuse to believe
that the Russians are smarter than us,

829
00:55:09,410 --> 00:55:12,710
AL HARRISON - or that they have more technology.
Or that they care more.

830
00:55:14,430 --> 00:55:16,030
AL HARRISON - But I don't know? Is that possible?

831
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:19,760
AL HARRISON - Is it possible that it actually means
more to them?

832
00:55:21,850 --> 00:55:24,060
AL HARRISON - We're in the fight of our lives, people.

833
00:55:24,650 --> 00:55:26,230
AL HARRISON - Not on some epic joyride!

834
00:55:27,690 --> 00:55:28,820
AL HARRISON - I just saw seven faces

835
00:55:29,690 --> 00:55:32,700
AL HARRISON - who weren't sure that
we can get there.

836
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:37,230
AL HARRISON - This is our problem.

837
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:40,230
AL HARRISON - And so, as of right now,

838
00:55:42,220 --> 00:55:44,254
AL HARRISON - There's only two things you
need to know going forward

839
00:55:44,279 --> 00:55:47,194
AL HARRISON - One is, staying here working late
that's gonna be a fact of life.

840
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:50,710
AL HARRISON - And two, don't expect your
paychecks reflect the extra time

841
00:55:50,735 --> 00:55:53,064
AL HARRISON - it is gonna take to catch
up and pass those bastards.

842
00:55:55,410 --> 00:55:57,241
AL HARRISON - For those of you that can't
work that way, I understand 'em

843
00:55:57,466 --> 00:55:59,234
AL HARRISON - thank you for
what you've done.

844
00:56:00,570 --> 00:56:01,870
AL HARRISON - For everyone else,

845
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:04,460
AL HARRISON - I suggest you call your wives..

846
00:56:05,170 --> 00:56:06,700
AL HARRISON - And tell them how it's gonna be.

847
00:56:07,070 --> 00:56:08,310
AL HARRISON - I'll start with mine.

848
00:57:06,130 --> 00:57:09,129
AL HARRISON - Sam, keep it up
OTHER - Yes, sir

849
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:29,650
PAUL STAFFORD - End of the day.

850
00:57:35,870 --> 00:57:37,850
OTHER - Okay. We're looking good...

851
00:57:41,950 --> 00:57:43,530
OTHER - Try!

852
00:57:53,915 --> 00:57:56,670
OTHER - Sir! It might be the selector latch!
OTHER  - I'm taking a walk!

853
00:57:56,694 --> 00:57:59,194
JOHN GLENN - We're honored to serve our country.
So, we don't think about..

854
00:57:59,935 --> 00:58:02,145
JOHN GLENN - Danger.
No time to be scared.

855
00:58:02,995 --> 00:58:04,055
JOHN GLENN - We got a job to do

856
00:58:13,494 --> 00:58:14,579
OTHER - Mrs. Jackson!

857
00:58:15,703 --> 00:58:17,979
OTHER - Colored seats are at the back
of the courtroom.

858
00:58:18,180 --> 00:58:19,360
MARY - Thank you, ma'am.

859
00:58:38,685 --> 00:58:41,285
OTHER - So, which one of you wants to go first?

860
00:59:04,165 --> 00:59:08,385
DOROTHY - The IBM 7090 Data Processing System,

861
00:59:08,525 --> 00:59:14,150
DOROTHY - It has a capability of solving of over
24,000 multiplications

862
00:59:15,410 --> 00:59:16,430
DOROTHY - per second!

863
00:59:16,455 --> 00:59:19,664
OTHER - Holy Moses, that's lightning fast
OTHER - They'll never get that to work.

864
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:24,070
DOROTHY - It'll run eventually. And when it does
we have to know how to program it.

865
00:59:24,170 --> 00:59:27,270
DOROTHY - Unless you'd rather be out of a job?
OTHER - No!

866
00:59:33,020 --> 00:59:34,220
MARY - Mr. Z.

867
00:59:35,244 --> 00:59:37,226
MARY - I got a court date.

868
00:59:40,905 --> 00:59:43,490
DOROTHY - Computer uses it as its high speed storage
unit

869
00:59:44,050 --> 00:59:45,685
DOROTHY - An information holding device.

870
00:59:48,110 --> 00:59:49,430
DOROTHY - So you have a brain

871
00:59:49,610 --> 00:59:51,230
DOROTHY - That, I can work with

872
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:57,400
DOROTHY - that's in the wrong spot

873
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:02,790
DOROTHY - That a girl!

874
01:00:06,110 --> 01:00:07,380
AL HARRISON - Ruth!
KATHERINE - Yes, sir.

875
01:00:07,390 --> 01:00:10,390
AL HARRISON - Get the Cape on the line.
Shepard's trajectories need to be updated.

876
01:00:15,950 --> 01:00:17,190
AL HARRISON - Where is she?

877
01:01:15,620 --> 01:01:17,140
AL HARRISON - Where the hell have you been?

878
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:19,470
AL HARRISON - Everywhere I look you're not
where I need you to be.

879
01:01:19,610 --> 01:01:22,420
AL HARRISON - And it's not my imagination. So where
the hell do you go everyday?

880
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:26,830
KATHERINE - To the bathroom, sir.

881
01:01:27,380 --> 01:01:28,590
AL HARRISON - The bathroom

882
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:31,550
AL HARRISON - To the damn bathroom!

883
01:01:32,210 --> 01:01:33,640
AL HARRISON - For 40 minutes a day?

884
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:37,820
AL HARRISON - What do you do in there?

885
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:41,330
AL HARRISON - We are T-0 here.
I put a lot of faith in you.

886
01:01:43,650 --> 01:01:45,630
KATHERINE - There's no bathroom for me here.

887
01:01:46,950 --> 01:01:48,990
AL HARRISON - What do you mean there's
no bathroom for you here?

888
01:01:49,014 --> 01:01:50,614
KATHERINE - There is no bathroom!

889
01:01:51,220 --> 01:01:53,440
KATHERINE - There are no colored bathrooms
in this building,

890
01:01:53,930 --> 01:01:56,068
KATHERINE - or any building outside the West Campus.

891
01:01:56,070 --> 01:01:59,100
KATHERINE - Which is half a mile away.
Did you know that?

892
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:03,610
KATHERINE - I have to walk to Timbuktu
just to relieve myself

893
01:02:04,020 --> 01:02:05,870
KATHERINE - And I can't use one of the handy bikes.

894
01:02:06,270 --> 01:02:08,180
AL HARRISON - Picture that, Mr. Harrison

895
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:09,760
KATHERINE - My uniform...

896
01:02:10,290 --> 01:02:12,410
KATHERINE - Skirt below my knees, my heels

897
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:16,040
KATHERINE - and simple string of pearls.
Well, I don't own pearls.

898
01:02:16,065 --> 01:02:19,464
KATHERINE - Lord knows you don't pay the
coloreds enough to afford pearls!

899
01:02:20,330 --> 01:02:23,780
KATHERINE - And I work like a dog day and night,

900
01:02:24,540 --> 01:02:28,560
KATHERINE - living off a coffee from a pot none of
you want to touch!

901
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:43,180
KATHERINE - So, excuse me..

902
01:02:44,110 --> 01:02:47,050
KATHERINE - If I have to go to the restroom
a few times a day

903
01:03:59,010 --> 01:04:00,600
AL HARRISON - There you have it!

904
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:06,750
AL HARRISON - No more colored restrooms.

905
01:04:06,830 --> 01:04:08,790
AL HARRISON - No more white restrooms.

906
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:12,190
AL HARRISON - Just plain old toilets.

907
01:04:12,350 --> 01:04:13,920
AL HARRISON - Go wherever you damn well please.

908
01:04:14,380 --> 01:04:16,070
AL HARRISON - Preferably closer to your desk.

909
01:04:23,635 --> 01:04:24,935
AL HARRISON - Here at NASA,

910
01:04:25,060 --> 01:04:26,600
AL HARRISON - we all pee the same color

911
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:57,180
JIM JOHNSON - Heard you were fighting the flu.
Thought you could use some soup?

912
01:04:57,404 --> 01:04:59,104
JIM JOHNSON - Hot meal for the girls.

913
01:05:00,028 --> 01:05:01,828
KATHERINE - Come on, in.

914
01:05:07,775 --> 01:05:08,975
KATHERINE - Excuse me

915
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,260
KATHERINE - OK, ladies
Let's say grace..

916
01:05:12,830 --> 01:05:14,150
KATHERINE - Bow your heads.

917
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:20,150
KATHERINE - Dear Lord!
Thank you for this meal..

918
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:24,670
KATHERINE - We ask that you blessed this food,
so that it may bless our bodies.

919
01:05:25,100 --> 01:05:26,350
KATHERINE - In Jesus name, we pray.

920
01:05:28,990 --> 01:05:30,750
KATHERINE - Amen.

921
01:05:34,594 --> 01:05:39,462

at an altitude about 116 miles an hour.

KATHERINE - Dorothy! Come on or you'll miss it!
DOROTHY - I'm coming.

924
01:05:58,447 --> 01:06:00,666
OTHER - Freedom 7, we're gonna have to
bleed off some of the pressure

925
01:06:00,984 --> 01:06:02,601
OTHER - the liquid oxygen tank

926
01:06:02,977 --> 01:06:05,121
OTHER - that should reduce the temperature
inside the capsule, over

927
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:07,540
OTHER - Any day now, Capcom.

928
01:06:07,550 --> 01:06:09,650

947
01:07:37,033 --> 01:07:40,234
OTHER - to the moon and to
the planets beyond..

948
01:07:40,860 --> 01:07:45,436
OTHER - And we have vowed...
that we shall not see it governed

949
01:07:45,461 --> 01:07:49,346
OTHER - by a hostile flag of conquest,
but by a banner

950
01:07:49,371 --> 01:07:54,733
OTHER - of freedom and peace.
We set sail on this new sea,

951
01:07:55,258 --> 01:07:58,678
OTHER - because there is new
knowledge to be gained

952
01:07:58,690 --> 01:08:00,450
OTHER - and new rights to be won

953
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:05,040
OTHER - We choose to go to the Moon in this decade
and do the other things

954
01:08:05,490 --> 01:08:08,989
OTHER - not because they are easy,
but because they are hard.

955
01:08:10,090 --> 01:08:13,789
PAUL STAFFORD - Suppose we should all thank President
Kennedy for continued job security.

956
01:08:17,770 --> 01:08:19,390
PAUL STAFFORD - Gus Grissom's up next.

957
01:08:19,570 --> 01:08:21,780
PAUL STAFFORD - Another suborbital flight with a Redstone.

958
01:08:22,910 --> 01:08:25,420
PAUL STAFFORD - Our last shot before we strap
Glenn to the Atlas..

959
01:08:25,480 --> 01:08:28,140
PAUL STAFFORD - And.. Pray we can brng him back down.

960
01:08:28,300 --> 01:08:31,520
AL HARRISON - Yes, and I imagine he'd like us to have
the math worked out beforehand.

961
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:35,010
AL HARRISON - Good work, gentlemen.

962

I kissed you, Kathe.

965

KATHERINE - Oh. And why's that?

966
01:09:19,830 --> 01:09:21,960
JIM JOHNSON - Figure you're attracted to me
the same as I to you.

967
01:09:24,020 --> 01:09:25,510
KATHERINE - Is that right?

968
01:09:26,820 --> 01:09:29,170
JIM JOHNSON - Or you would have told me to
get going a long time ago.

969
01:09:43,850 --> 01:09:45,500
KATHERINE - Haven't kissed a man in a long time.

970
01:09:47,450 --> 01:09:48,570

01:10:23,370 --> 01:10:25,260
OTHER - Everyone needs to see this.

976
01:10:30,910 --> 01:10:34,121
OTHER - We think we're rendering a
great service to our nation.

977
01:10:34,146 --> 01:10:37,234
OTHER - For this is not a struggle
for ourselves alone.

978
01:10:37,300 --> 01:10:39,720

the soul of America.

OTHER - Regardless of what the Federal
Government says, or regardless what..

01:11:05,850 --> 01:11:07,390
OTHER - Supreme Court says our law..

987
01:11:08,250 --> 01:11:09,490
OTHER - Is the law.

988
01:11:09,570 --> 01:11:11,180
MARY - Your Honor,
if I may.

989

to be considered.

990
01:11:14,710 --> 01:11:17,350
OTHER - What would warrant
a colored woman attendin' a white school?

991
01:11:19,510 --> 01:11:20,990
MARY - May I approach the bench, sir?

992
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:35,800
MARY - Your Honor,

993
01:11:35,850 --> 01:11:38,560
MARY - You of all people should understand
the importance of being first.

994
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:41,940
OTHER - How's that, Mrs. Jackson?

995
01:11:42,310 --> 01:11:44,260
MARY - Well, you were the first in your family

996
01:11:44,340 --> 01:11:46,110
MARY - to serve in the Armed Forces.

997
01:11:46,220 --> 01:11:47,790
MARY - US Navy.

998
01:11:47,860 --> 01:11:49,690
MARY - The first to attend University.

999
01:11:50,370 --> 01:11:51,980
MARY - George Mason.

1000
01:11:52,020 --> 01:11:56,370
MARY - And the first State Judge to be re-commissioned
by three consecutive Governors.

1001
01:11:57,030 --> 01:11:58,750
OTHER - You've done some research.

1002
01:11:59,150 --> 01:12:00,420
MARY - Yes, sir.

1003
01:12:00,750 --> 01:12:01,794
OTHER - What's the point?

1004
01:12:02,019 --> 01:12:03,844
MARY - The point is, your Honor...

1005
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:08,260
MARY - No Negro woman in the State of Virginia
has ever attended an all white high school.

1006
01:12:08,470 --> 01:12:11,300
MARY - It's unheard of.
MARY - Yeah! Unheard of.

1007
01:12:12,270 --> 01:12:14,930
MARY - And before Alan Shepard
sat on top of a rocket,

1008
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:16,650
MARY - no other American had ever touched space.

1009
01:12:17,590 --> 01:12:22,030
MARY - And now, he will forever be remembered
as the US Navy man from New Hampshire.

1010
01:12:22,340 --> 01:12:24,150
MARY - The first to touch the stars.

1011
01:12:25,980 --> 01:12:27,200
MARY - And I, sir.

1012
01:12:27,370 --> 01:12:29,630
MARY - I plan on being an engineer at NASA.

1013
01:12:30,110 --> 01:12:33,930
MARY - But I can't do that without taking them
classes at that all-white high school.

1014
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:36,760
MARY - And I can't change the color of my skin.

1015
01:12:38,100 --> 01:12:41,570
MARY - So, I have no choice.. But to be the first.

1016
01:12:42,460 --> 01:12:44,510
MARY - Which I can't do without you, sir.

1017
01:12:45,260 --> 01:12:46,720
MARY - Your Honor,

1018
01:12:46,810 --> 01:12:48,580
MARY - of all the cases you'll hear today,

1019
01:12:49,350 --> 01:12:51,200
MARY - which one will matter in a hundred years from now?

1020
01:12:52,670 --> 01:12:54,580
MARY - Which one will make you the "first?"

1021
01:13:06,660 --> 01:13:08,200
OTHER - Only the night classes.

1022
01:13:08,990 --> 01:13:10,640
OTHER - Mrs. Jackson.

1023
01:13:49,350 --> 01:13:52,349
AL HARRISON - How late did you say it was gonna be?
OTHER - No more than 5 minutes sir.

1024
01:13:52,850 --> 01:13:54,229
KATHERINE - Gus Grissom's coordinates..

1025
01:13:54,253 --> 01:13:57,663
KATHERINE - I'd like to get a jump on
John Glenn's trajectory.

1026
01:13:58,360 --> 01:14:00,420
PAUL STAFFORD - Do you have any idea what you're asking?

1027
01:14:00,421 --> 01:14:02,990
KATHERINE - An orbital launch
with an Atlas Rocket is going to take time.

1028
01:14:03,450 --> 01:14:04,790
AL HARRISON - Is there a problem?

1029
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:08,590
KATHERINE - Mr. Harrison...

1030
01:14:09,010 --> 01:14:10,720
KATHERINE - I was wondering....

1031
01:14:10,720 --> 01:14:14,260
AL HARRISON - I've been wondering my whole life.
So just... Spit it out.

1032
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:16,380
KATHERINE - Well, sir.

1033
01:14:18,570 --> 01:14:21,210
KATHERINE - I'd like to get a jump on
John Glenn's trajectory.

1034
01:14:21,330 --> 01:14:24,130
AL HARRISON - This isn't about plugging in numbers,
this is about inventing the math.

1035
01:14:24,180 --> 01:14:26,844
AL HARRISON - I think we talked about that, right?
It doesn't exist.

1036
01:14:26,869 --> 01:14:28,074
KATHERINE - I can do it, sir.

1037
01:14:28,140 --> 01:14:31,140
PAUL STAFFORD - Do you know any idea how exacting
these calculations have to be?

1038
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:34,420
KATHERINE - It's like shooting a sawed-off shotgun
from a thousand feet,

1039
01:14:34,445 --> 01:14:37,259
KATHERINE - and getting that one beebee through a hole
so tiny, you can't even see it.

1040
01:14:37,260 --> 01:14:38,984
KATHERINE - I'm an excellent shot, sir.

1041
01:14:39,270 --> 01:14:41,230
AL HARRISON - How about Grissom's numbers. Paul?

1042
01:14:42,220 --> 01:14:43,570
PAUL STAFFORD - They've been spot on.

1043
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:47,870
AL HARRISON - Give Glenn's orbit a go.

1044
01:14:49,110 --> 01:14:51,100
AL HARRISON - But you run it all through Stafford.
Understood?

1045
01:14:51,101 --> 01:14:52,145
KATHERINE - Yes, sir.

1046
01:14:52,370 --> 01:14:54,090
KATHERINE - Thank you.

1047
01:14:57,780 --> 01:14:59,510
PAUL STAFFORD - Computers don't author reports.

1048
01:15:06,688 --> 01:15:08,342
OTHER - Capcom, this is Liberty Bell 7

1049
01:15:09,395 --> 01:15:10,380
OTHER - loud and clear

1050
01:15:12,419 --> 01:15:14,142
OTHER - ok, it's nice ride up to now

1051
01:15:23,700 --> 01:15:26,750
OTHER - Liberty Bell 7 capsule is taking on water.

1052
01:15:27,020 --> 01:15:32,630
OTHER - Gus Grissom is out of the capsule. Rescuers
are now going to pull him from the Ocean waves.

1053
01:15:33,070 --> 01:15:35,640
OTHER - Unfortunately,
Liberty Bell 7 capsule..

1054
01:15:36,064 --> 01:15:37,664
OTHER - .. Is lost.

1055
01:15:48,270 --> 01:15:51,740
OTHER - Mr. Harrison, Taxpayer money sank in
the ocean along with your capsule.

1056
01:15:51,820 --> 01:15:54,540
OTHER - What makes you think you can
bring John Glenn home safely?

1057
01:15:55,190 --> 01:15:58,860
AL HARRISON - Let me say first that discovery is never
for the sake of discovery, Gentlemen,

1058
01:15:58,870 --> 01:16:00,510
AL HARRISON - but for the sake of human survival.

1059
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:03,170
AL HARRISON - It will always come with the risk.

1060
01:16:05,550 --> 01:16:09,650
AL HARRISON - Whoever gets there first, will make the rules.
That's been true of every civilization. And so..

1061
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:13,420
AL HARRISON - I think the bigger question for
this body to consider is..

1062
01:16:13,444 --> 01:16:16,800
AL HARRISON - Who do you want calling the shots in space?

1063
01:16:17,900 --> 01:16:19,900
AL HARRISON - We have to know what's out there, Senator.

1064
01:16:20,660 --> 01:16:24,240
AL HARRISON - We have to touch the stars. If
only to ensure our own survival.

1065
01:16:24,265 --> 01:16:26,054
AL HARRISON - And only a man can do that.

1066
01:16:28,380 --> 01:16:30,510
AL HARRISON - We'll get John Glenn home safely
because we have to,

1067
01:16:32,310 --> 01:16:34,010
AL HARRISON - because he has to tell us what he saw.

1068
01:16:38,120 --> 01:16:39,890
PAUL STAFFORD - The Redstone Rocket went straight up.

1069
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:41,410
PAUL STAFFORD - But the capsule..

1070
01:16:41,630 --> 01:16:44,250
PAUL STAFFORD - .. Didn't have enough speed to go
into orbit. So came back down.

1071
01:16:44,940 --> 01:16:48,050
PAUL STAFFORD - Essentially it's a triangle..
Earth, sub-orbit, Earth.

1072
01:16:48,430 --> 01:16:49,810
PAUL STAFFORD - That math was known.

1073
01:16:49,890 --> 01:16:52,450
PAUL STAFFORD - That took Shepard,
took Grissom.

1074
01:16:53,300 --> 01:16:55,160
PAUL STAFFORD - That cannot take Glenn.

1075
01:16:56,040 --> 01:16:57,600
PAUL STAFFORD - Now, The Atlas Rocket..

1076
01:16:58,470 --> 01:17:01,475
PAUL STAFFORD - That can push us into orbit.
It goes up

1077
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:04,414
PAUL STAFFORD - delivers the capsule
into an elliptical orbit.

1078
01:17:04,450 --> 01:17:05,788
PAUL STAFFORD - Earth's gravity keeps pulling it,

1079
01:17:05,813 --> 01:17:08,174
PAUL STAFFORD - but it's going so fast that
it keeps missing the Earth.

1080
01:17:08,770 --> 01:17:10,130
PAUL STAFFORD - That's how it stays in orbit.

1081
01:17:11,050 --> 01:17:12,870
PAUL STAFFORD - Now, Getting it back down...

1082
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:15,880
PAUL STAFFORD - That's the math we don't know.

1083
01:17:17,900 --> 01:17:19,060
PAUL STAFFORD - Yes, Katherine

1084
01:17:19,070 --> 01:17:21,718
KATHERINE - So, the capsule will spin
around the Earth forever,

1085
01:17:21,743 --> 01:17:23,774
KATHERINE - because there's nothing
to slow it down?

1086
01:17:24,340 --> 01:17:28,660
PAUL STAFFORD - That's right. Slowing it down at precisely
the right moment,

1087
01:17:28,810 --> 01:17:30,450
PAUL STAFFORD - by precisely the right amount

1088
01:17:30,460 --> 01:17:31,590
PAUL STAFFORD - That is the task.

1089
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:35,760
PAUL STAFFORD - Yes, Katherine

1090
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:42,920
KATHERINE - So, it means to move from an
elliptical orbit.. To a parabolic orbit?

1091
01:17:43,170 --> 01:17:45,700
PAUL STAFFORD - Yes.
That's the Go/ No Go.

1092
01:17:47,020 --> 01:17:48,790
PAUL STAFFORD - Now, this point is a pin head.

1093
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:52,900
PAUL STAFFORD - We bring him in too soon..
OTHER - He burns up on reentry.

1094
01:17:53,501 --> 01:17:57,630
PAUL STAFFORD - That's right. We bring him too late,
and he's pushed out of Earth's gravity.

1095
01:17:57,770 --> 01:18:00,740
KATHERINE - Any changes to mass, weight, speed, time,

1096
01:18:01,300 --> 01:18:07,350
KATHERINE - distance, friction... or a puff of wind..
Would alter the Go/No Go.

1097
01:18:07,730 --> 01:18:10,580
KATHERINE - And we start our calculations.. Over

1098
01:18:11,304 --> 01:18:12,804
KATHERINE - Yes.

1099
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:17,257
PAUL STAFFORD - So, we need to be able to
choose this re-entry point.

1100
01:18:17,882 --> 01:18:20,904
PAUL STAFFORD - This Go/No Go.
This has to be exact.

1101
01:18:21,250 --> 01:18:22,330
PAUL STAFFORD  - Sam

1102
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:26,210
PAUL STAFFORD - These are the latest Redstone numbers
and current capsule data.

1103
01:18:26,350 --> 01:18:28,430
PAUL STAFFORD - Obviously, we know the launch spot

1104
01:18:28,710 --> 01:18:32,766
PAUL STAFFORD - The Pentagon Briefing should illuminate
where the Navy needs the recovery zone.

1105
01:18:32,791 --> 01:18:34,814
PAUL STAFFORD - When we work backwards from there.

1106
01:18:35,380 --> 01:18:37,920
PAUL STAFFORD - And the rest is on us.
So, let's get to work.

1107
01:18:38,980 --> 01:18:41,816
KATHERINE - Mr. Stafford.
PAUL STAFFORD - What, Katherine?

1108
01:18:41,841 --> 01:18:45,514
KATHERINE - If I could attend the briefings, I
would be more useful to the project.

1109
01:18:45,540 --> 01:18:47,630
PAUL STAFFORD - Pentagon briefing is a closed door.

1110
01:18:47,680 --> 01:18:50,300
KATHERINE - Yes. But if we don't
have the information,

1111
01:18:51,010 --> 01:18:54,822
KATHERINE - of the changes.. We can't keep up.
I need those changes as they occur.

1112
01:18:54,847 --> 01:18:57,505
KATHERINE - As you said, it's a pin head.
PAUL STAFFORD - Katherine, that's the job.

1113
01:18:57,530 --> 01:19:00,840
PAUL STAFFORD - You asked for this assignment.
So just calculate with what you have.

1114
01:19:01,720 --> 01:19:03,460
PAUL STAFFORD - Or we'll find someone who can.

1115
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:11,820
DOROTHY - OK.

1116
01:19:24,350 --> 01:19:25,570
DOROTHY - That'a girl.

1117
01:19:26,475 --> 01:19:28,775
OTHER - And what the hell are you doing?
You can't be in here

1118
01:19:29,099 --> 01:19:30,299
OTHER - Who are you?

1119
01:19:30,300 --> 01:19:32,320
DOROTHY - I'm with the West Computing Group.

1120
01:19:32,920 --> 01:19:34,254
DOROTHY - Dorothy Vaughan, sir.

1121
01:19:34,279 --> 01:19:36,424
OTHER - Well, this is a very
delicate piece of equipment.

1122
01:19:36,490 --> 01:19:39,170
DOROTHY - I'm sorry, sir.
I'm just trying to be helpful.

1123
01:19:39,194 --> 01:19:40,894
OTHER - Bill, we've got numbers.

1124
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:44,650
OTHER - What kind of numbers?

1125
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:50,570
OTHER - Well, I'll be.

1126
01:19:51,310 --> 01:19:52,950
OTHER - What's your name again?

1127
01:19:53,270 --> 01:19:54,830
DOROTHY - Dorothy Vaughan.

1128
01:19:55,620 --> 01:19:57,060
OTHER - Dorothy Vaughan...

1129
01:20:04,170 --> 01:20:06,875
KATHERINE - Sir, the parameters
for Friendship 7.

1130
01:20:06,900 --> 01:20:10,504
PAUL STAFFORD - Oh, this is all moot. We're
altering the window on the capsule.

1131
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:11,712
KATHERINE - When did this happen?

1132
01:20:11,737 --> 01:20:13,944
PAUL STAFFORD - 6 minutes ago. The mass is changing.
Start over.

1133
01:20:13,968 --> 01:20:17,640
KATHERINE - Sir.. If I could attend briefings..
I could stay current..

1134
01:20:17,650 --> 01:20:19,830
PAUL STAFFORD - Katherine, we've been through this.
It is not possible.

1135
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:21,460
PAUL STAFFORD - There's no protocol for women attending.

1136
01:20:21,910 --> 01:20:24,203
KATHERINE - There's no protocol for a man
circling the Earth either, sir.

1137
01:20:24,228 --> 01:20:26,094
PAUL STAFFORD - OK. That's just
the way things are.

1138
01:21:01,030 --> 01:21:04,200
KATHERINE - Colonel Glenn's launch coordinates
accounting for the window change, sir.

1139
01:21:04,290 --> 01:21:07,289
PAUL STAFFORD - I've told you this: Computers don't
author reports. Fix it.

1140
01:21:07,335 --> 01:21:09,435
KATHERINE - Those are my calculations.
My name should be on it.

1141
01:21:09,559 --> 01:21:11,159
PAUL STAFFORD - But it is not the way this works.

1142
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:13,790
AL HARRISON - Paul.
What's happening here?

1143
01:21:13,791 --> 01:21:16,620
KATHERINE - Mr. Harrison,
I'd like to attend today's briefing.

1144
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:19,460
AL HARRISON - Why's that?
KATHERINE - Well, sir, the data changes so fast.

1145
01:21:19,550 --> 01:21:23,620
KATHERINE - The capsule changes. The weight and the
landing zones are all changing everyday.

1146
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:27,390
KATHERINE - I do my work, you attend these briefings.
I have to start all over.

1147
01:21:27,780 --> 01:21:29,850
KATHERINE - Colonel Glenn launches in a few weeks.

1148
01:21:30,290 --> 01:21:31,860
KATHERINE - We don't have the math figured out yet.

1149
01:21:32,775 --> 01:21:35,374
AL HARRISON - Why is it she can't attend?
PAUL STAFFORD - Because she doesn't have clearance, Al.

1150
01:21:35,375 --> 01:21:38,674
KATHERINE - I can not do my work effectively
if I do not have all of the data,

1151
01:21:38,675 --> 01:21:40,780
KATHERINE - and all of the information
as soon as it's available.

1152
01:21:40,870 --> 01:21:42,469
KATHERINE - I need to be in that room,
hearing what you hear.

1153
01:21:42,470 --> 01:21:45,665
PAUL STAFFORD - Pentagon Briefings are not for civilians.
It requires the highest clearance.

1154
01:21:45,689 --> 01:21:47,289
KATHERINE - I feel like I'm the best person
to present my calculations

1155
01:21:47,380 --> 01:21:49,280
AL HARRISON - You're not gonna let this go are you?
KATHERINE - No, I'm not

1156
01:21:49,304 --> 01:21:52,804
PAUL STAFFORD - Let her in? She's a woman.
There's no protocol for a woman attending.

1157
01:21:52,828 --> 01:21:54,828
AL HARRISON - Okay, I get that part, Paul.

1158
01:21:57,470 --> 01:22:01,130
AL HARRISON - But within these walls,
who... makes the rules?

1159
01:22:01,260 --> 01:22:06,370
KATHERINE - You, sir. You're the boss.
You just have to act like one. Sir.

1160
01:22:15,230 --> 01:22:16,370
AL HARRISON - You keep quiet.

1161
01:22:17,300 --> 01:22:18,679
KATHERINE - Thank you.

1162
01:22:19,204 --> 01:22:20,794
PAUL STAFFORD - Good morning.

1163
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:22,990
PAUL STAFFORD - Gentlemen

1164
01:22:31,660 --> 01:22:35,270
AL HARRISON - This is Katherine Goble with our
Trajectory and Launch Window Division.

1165
01:22:36,040 --> 01:22:37,850
AL HARRISON - Her work is pertinent to
today's proceedings.

1166
01:22:39,590 --> 01:22:42,700
AL HARRISON - Come on.
Go get her a chair.

1167
01:22:44,310 --> 01:22:45,747
AL HARRISON - We have a confirmed
launch window..

1168
01:22:45,772 --> 01:22:47,145
AL HARRISON - Give her your chair.
OTHER - Yes, sir.

1169
01:22:47,370 --> 01:22:50,730
AL HARRISON - We have a confirmed launch window for
friendship 7. Let's discuss a landing zone.

1170
01:22:51,460 --> 01:22:53,400
OTHER - The Navy needs a singular landing zone.

1171
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:56,300
OTHER - 20 miles square is what we can
service for retrieval.

1172
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:59,310
OTHER - Outside of that,
we risk the capsule's recovery.

1173
01:22:59,500 --> 01:23:01,430
PAUL STAFFORD - We'd like 3 possible recovery areas.

1174
01:23:01,710 --> 01:23:03,500
OTHER - We can't cover half the damn ocean.

1175
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,630
AL HARRISON - With all due respect,
our capsule's being altered daily.

1176
01:23:07,870 --> 01:23:10,040
AL HARRISON - We're orbiting the Earth at...
what's the speed now?

1177
01:23:16,430 --> 01:23:18,390
KATHERINE - 17,544 miles per hour.

1178
01:23:19,130 --> 01:23:22,060
KATHERINE - At the time the rocket delivers the
capsule into low space orbit.

1179
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:27,470
JOHN GLENN - That's one hell of a speeding ticket.

1180
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:32,379
OTHER - OK.
So we have the vehicle's speed,

1181
01:23:32,380 --> 01:23:36,270
OTHER - the launch window and for argument's sake,
the landing zone is The Bahamas.

1182
01:23:37,160 --> 01:23:38,940
OTHER - Should be enough to figure the Go/No Go?

1183
01:23:39,200 --> 01:23:42,465
PAUL STAFFORD - Yeah! In theory, sir.
OTHER - We need to be past theory at this point.

1184
01:23:42,590 --> 01:23:45,254
AL HARRISON - We'll be able to calculate a
Go/No Go with that information.

1185
01:23:45,350 --> 01:23:47,150
OTHER - When exactly is that gonna happen?

1186
01:23:58,680 --> 01:23:59,690
AL HARRISON - Katherine.

1187
01:24:01,890 --> 01:24:03,450
AL HARRISON - Have a go at it?

1188
01:24:28,820 --> 01:24:30,960
KATHERINE - The Go point for re-entry

1189
01:24:31,240 --> 01:24:34,730
KATHERINE - is 2,990 miles

1190
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:37,210
KATHERINE - from where we want Colonel Glenn to land.

1191
01:24:38,040 --> 01:24:39,960
KATHERINE - If we assume that's The Bahamas.

1192
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:45,630
KATHERINE - At 17,544 miles per hour..

1193
01:24:46,300 --> 01:24:47,440
KATHERINE - Upon reentry..

1194
01:24:48,200 --> 01:24:49,530
KATHERINE - 370..

1195
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:51,920
KATHERINE - At a descent angle..

1196
01:24:52,240 --> 01:24:54,450
KATHERINE - Of 46.56 ..

1197
01:24:55,480 --> 01:24:57,700
KATHERINE - Degrees..
Distance..

1198
01:25:32,760 --> 01:25:34,500
KATHERINE - OK!
So, that puts the landing zone at...

1199
01:25:34,540 --> 01:25:38,450
KATHERINE - 25.0667 North,

1200
01:25:38,460 --> 01:25:41,220
KATHERINE - 77.3333 West.

1201
01:25:42,970 --> 01:25:44,200
KATHERINE - Which is here

1202
01:25:47,650 --> 01:25:51,240
KATHERINE - Right here.
Give or take 20 square miles.

1203
01:25:56,590 --> 01:25:57,820
JOHN GLENN - I like her numbers.

1204
01:25:59,190 --> 01:26:00,220
KATHERINE - Thank you.

1205
01:26:01,460 --> 01:26:05,720
OTHER - That of course is assuming the ..
Capsule hits the reentry point exactly

1206
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:07,810
OTHER - How do we insure that?

1207
01:26:09,160 --> 01:26:11,160
AL HARRISON - That's the math we don't
have yet, gentlemen.

1208
01:26:11,530 --> 01:26:12,880
AL HARRISON - We're working on it.

1209
01:26:15,250 --> 01:26:16,560
AL HARRISON - Katherine

1210
01:26:20,200 --> 01:26:22,699
AL HARRISON - What's it gonna take to make
this thing worth the price tag?

1211
01:26:22,700 --> 01:26:24,799
OTHER - We're just getting up to speed here,
Mr. Harrison.

1212
01:26:24,823 --> 01:26:26,299
OTHER - I need more man power.

1213
01:26:26,300 --> 01:26:28,125
OTHER - I mean Programmers.
Folks to feed the cards.

1214
01:26:28,150 --> 01:26:30,564
AL HARRISON - Then get them, for crying out loud.
Right?

1215
01:26:30,940 --> 01:26:32,980
AL HARRISON - You're the IBM man, right?
VIVIAN MITCHELL - Yes, sir.

1216
01:26:32,990 --> 01:26:35,487
AL HARRISON - Pull them out of the sky if you
have to, but let's get ahead of

1217
01:26:35,512 --> 01:26:37,934
AL HARRISON - this thing. Or I'm not paying you.
OTHER - Understood

1218
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:43,390
OTHER - I got that one

1219
01:26:44,820 --> 01:26:46,420
AL HARRISON - I'm not paying any of you!

1220
01:26:56,140 --> 01:26:58,770
DOROTHY - Me?
VIVIAN MITCHELL - Temporarily. Yes.

1221
01:26:59,094 --> 01:27:01,094
VIVIAN MITCHELL - We need the IBM for Glenn's launch.

1222
01:27:01,420 --> 01:27:04,570
VIVIAN MITCHELL - The Lead Engineer says you're good
with the cards, programming and such.

1223
01:27:05,270 --> 01:27:06,598
DOROTHY - What about the girls here?

1224
01:27:06,623 --> 01:27:10,504
VIVIAN MITCHELL - Human computers can't calculate an
orbital flight in the time we have.

1225
01:27:10,900 --> 01:27:14,380
VIVIAN MITCHELL - They'll stay put for now.
DOROTHY - What about after "now"?

1226
01:27:15,170 --> 01:27:19,940
VIVIAN MITCHELL - After the Glenn launch, NASA's
dissolvin' the Computing Groups.

1227
01:27:22,500 --> 01:27:24,320
DOROTHY - I'm not accepting reassignment.

1228
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:25,980
DOROTHY - Unless, I bring my ladies with me.

1229
01:27:27,250 --> 01:27:28,263
VIVIAN MITCHELL - Excuse me?

1230
01:27:28,488 --> 01:27:30,925
DOROTHY - We're going to need a lot of
manpower to program that beast.

1231
01:27:30,950 --> 01:27:33,380
DOROTHY - I can't do it alone.
My girls are ready

1232
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:35,850
DOROTHY - They can do the work.

1233
01:27:39,470 --> 01:27:44,330
DOROTHY - Ladies!
We've been reassigned.

1234
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:48,460
DOROTHY - Leave your calculators.
You won't need them where we're going.

1235
01:28:48,915 --> 01:28:50,875
DOROTHY - Welcome, ladies!

1236
01:29:01,130 --> 01:29:02,940
AL HARRISON - Do you know what your job is, Paul?

1237
01:29:04,710 --> 01:29:06,850
AL HARRISON - To find the genius among those geniuses.

1238
01:29:07,030 --> 01:29:08,680
AL HARRISON - To pull us all up.

1239
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:14,210
AL HARRISON - We all get to the peak together,
or we.. Don't get there at all.

1240
01:29:17,510 --> 01:29:19,770
PAUL STAFFORD - Yes. Well.
Good night, sir.

1241
01:29:49,030 --> 01:29:50,830
MARY - I don't know what time
I'm coming home.

1242
01:29:51,010 --> 01:29:52,650
MARY - The class ends at 9.

1243
01:29:56,020 --> 01:29:57,770
MARY - You got something to say?

1244
01:29:59,120 --> 01:30:00,740
OTHER - Thought you might need these.

1245
01:30:04,050 --> 01:30:06,410
OTHER - You can refill em with any weight
lead you want.

1246
01:30:07,370 --> 01:30:10,200
OTHER - See, you just hit the top like this.

1247
01:30:11,860 --> 01:30:13,030
OTHER - Lead comes out

1248
01:30:14,100 --> 01:30:15,390
OTHER - You put the new lead in..

1249
01:30:15,750 --> 01:30:18,690
OTHER - And.. New pencil

1250
01:30:22,610 --> 01:30:24,560
OTHER - You will make a fine engineer.

1251
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:28,060
MARY - You think so?
PAUL STAFFORD - Yes.

1252
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:36,120
OTHER - And nobody dare stand in the way of
Mary Jackson's dreams. Myself included.

1253
01:30:41,465 --> 01:30:44,465
MARY - Don't make me mad again.
OTHER - Yes, ma'am.

1254
01:30:48,540 --> 01:30:50,330
MARY - And don't make me late either.

1255
01:30:50,990 --> 01:30:52,450
MARY - You don't really want me to make you?

1256
01:31:00,750 --> 01:31:04,044
OTHER - Hi, gentlemen.
Tonight we discuss PlanckEinstein.

1257
01:31:04,069 --> 01:31:05,994
OTHER - Wavelength relationships..

1258
01:31:10,170 --> 01:31:11,250
OTHER - Yes?

1259
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:15,800
MARY - I'm Mary Jackson.
I'm enrolled.

1260
01:31:17,800 --> 01:31:21,000
OTHER - Well. The curriculum is not designed
for teaching... a woman.

1261
01:31:21,750 --> 01:31:23,640
MARY - Well, I imagine it's the same as
teaching a man.

1262
01:31:25,580 --> 01:31:29,220
MARY - I don't see a colored section.
Should I just take any seat?

1263
01:31:34,868 --> 01:31:36,668
MARY - Thank you.

1264
01:31:41,060 --> 01:31:42,400
OTHER - OK.

1265
01:31:43,590 --> 01:31:45,260
OTHER - PlanckEinstein...

1266
01:31:46,480 --> 01:31:52,120
KATHERINE - The problem is when the capsule moves
from an elliptical orbit to a parabolic orbit.

1267
01:31:52,980 --> 01:31:54,990
KATHERINE - There's no mathematical formula for that.

1268
01:31:55,480 --> 01:31:57,880
KATHERINE - As we can calculate launch, landing

1269
01:31:57,920 --> 01:32:01,830
KATHERINE - but without this conversion, the capsule
stays in orbit, we can't bring it back home.

1270
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:06,530
AL HARRISON - Maybe we've been thinking about this
all wrong.

1271
01:32:06,690 --> 01:32:08,280
PAUL STAFFORD - How's that?

1272
01:32:12,230 --> 01:32:14,060
AL HARRISON - Maybe it's not new math at all.

1273
01:32:15,900 --> 01:32:17,550
KATHERINE - It could be old math.

1274
01:32:18,760 --> 01:32:21,790
KATHERINE - Something that looks at the problem
numerically, and not theoretically

1275
01:32:22,700 --> 01:32:26,410
KATHERINE - Math is always dependable.
AL HARRISON - For you it is.

1276
01:32:33,380 --> 01:32:34,540
KATHERINE - Euler's Method.

1277
01:32:34,610 --> 01:32:36,420
KATHERINE - Euler's Method?
KATHERINE - Yes.

1278
01:32:36,420 --> 01:32:39,430
PAUL STAFFORD - That's ancient.
KATHERINE - But it works!

1279
01:32:39,920 --> 01:32:41,690
KATHERINE - It works numerically.

1280
01:33:17,660 --> 01:33:19,360
PAUL STAFFORD - That's it!

1281
01:33:21,240 --> 01:33:23,830
PAUL STAFFORD - Let's type it up.

1282
01:33:48,945 --> 01:33:50,545
VIVIAN MITCHELL - Dorothy.

1283
01:33:50,970 --> 01:33:52,670
DOROTHY - Mrs. Mitchell.

1284
01:33:58,640 --> 01:34:00,320
DOROTHY - You're working late today?

1285
01:34:01,530 --> 01:34:03,520
VIVIAN MITCHELL - Seems always happened that way

1286
01:34:03,850 --> 01:34:05,690
DOROTHY - Yes.
Seems to.

1287
01:34:14,205 --> 01:34:15,605
VIVIAN MITCHELL - Thank you.

1288
01:34:18,680 --> 01:34:22,240
VIVIAN MITCHELL - I hear the IBM is at full capacity.

1289
01:34:22,735 --> 01:34:24,435
VIVIAN MITCHELL - You certainly have a knack for it

1290
01:34:25,160 --> 01:34:27,430
DOROTHY - My father taught me a thing or
two about mechanics.

1291
01:34:28,850 --> 01:34:33,070
DOROTHY - You know, I have a few girls in the East Group
that have an interest in learnin' more about it.

1292
01:34:33,160 --> 01:34:36,640
DOROTHY - It is the future.
VIVIAN MITCHELL - I may bring em by, if it's all the same to you.

1293
01:34:38,220 --> 01:34:41,600
DOROTHY - That's not my decision. Ma'am.
That would be the supervisor's.

1294
01:34:43,124 --> 01:34:45,124
DOROTHY - Yes. That's true.

1295
01:34:45,720 --> 01:34:48,280
DOROTHY - Well.
Good night, Mrs. Mitchell.

1296
01:34:50,410 --> 01:34:51,820
VIVIAN MITCHELL - You know, Dorothy...

1297
01:34:53,640 --> 01:34:58,420
VIVIAN MITCHELL - Despite what you may think..
I have nothin' against ya'll.

1298
01:34:59,300 --> 01:35:03,280
DOROTHY - I know.
I know you probably believe that.

1299
01:35:16,125 --> 01:35:17,625
DOROTHY - Goodnight, Katherine.

1300
01:35:18,450 --> 01:35:19,950
KATHERINE - Good night!

1301
01:35:21,940 --> 01:35:24,530
OTHER - Mamma.
KATHERINE - Hey, baby

1302
01:35:24,550 --> 01:35:27,110
KATHERINE - Hi!
Hey!

1303
01:35:28,710 --> 01:35:31,130
KATHERINE - Please don't tell me I miss
someone's birthday

1312
01:36:04,260 --> 01:36:05,630
KATHERINE - You, really?

1313
01:36:08,230 --> 01:36:10,130
KATHERINE - Okay, I'm not going to do this all night...

1314
01:36:12,854 --> 01:36:14,854

That's for me?

as you can get.

1325
01:36:51,590 --> 01:36:53,330
JIM JOHNSON - The day I met you, I called my mother...

1326
01:36:53,860 --> 01:36:57,040
JIM JOHNSON - I said: "Mom!
I met the woman I want to marry."

1330
01:37:02,138 --> 01:37:07,938
JIM JOHNSON - I said: "No, She is more than Something,
She is Everything."

1331
01:37:11,150 --> 01:37:14,390
JIM JOHNSON - I planned on this being more romantic.
I'll make that up to you real soon.

1336
01:37:36,670 --> 01:37:39,880

IBM 790 data processing

1341
01:37:56,934 --> 01:38:01,054

01:38:01,080 --> 01:38:04,880
OTHER - The modifications and equipment installations
are progressing on the schedule.

1343
01:38:05,530 --> 01:38:06,470

1344
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:09,820
KATHERINE - You wanted to see me, sir?
AL HARRISON - Have a seat

1345
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:12,840
KATHERINE - Is there something wrong, Mr. Harrison?

1346
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:14,290
AL HARRISON - No. There's nothing wrong.

1347
01:38:16,290 --> 01:38:19,510
AL HARRISON - In fact our IBM is churning out numbers
in fractions of the time any human can

1348
01:38:20,180 --> 01:38:21,830
AL HARRISON - Present company included.

1349
01:38:22,850 --> 01:38:24,320
KATHERINE - That's good then.

1350
01:38:27,310 --> 01:38:28,730
AL HARRISON - Maybe.

1351
01:38:29,170 --> 01:38:32,460
AL HARRISON - The thing is, the Cape is now insisting on
doing all the backups down there. On site.

1352
01:38:34,480 --> 01:38:35,490
KATHERINE - I see.

1353
01:38:35,560 --> 01:38:37,270
AL HARRISON - So, we won't be running backups here.

1354
01:38:38,780 --> 01:38:41,090
AL HARRISON - And truth be told, we can't keep up
with that IBM anyhow.

1355
01:38:44,930 --> 01:38:47,780
AL HARRISON - Long story short, we no longer need a..
Computer in this department.

1356
01:38:49,940 --> 01:38:51,810
AL HARRISON - Progress is a double edged sword.

1357
01:38:57,150 --> 01:38:59,467
AL HARRISON - Let's have you report back
to the West Group for now.

1358
01:38:59,492 --> 01:39:03,464
AL HARRISON - I'll see if we can find another assignment.
KATHERINE - Thank you, sir.

1359
01:39:07,110 --> 01:39:11,500
AL HARRISON - Katherine, I'm..
I'm sorry about this

1360
01:39:13,330 --> 01:39:15,380
AL HARRISON - It's out of my hands, if you
can believe that.

1361
01:39:16,390 --> 01:39:17,880
KATHERINE - I understand.

1362
01:39:41,610 --> 01:39:45,980
RUTH - Katherine..
We heard you got engaged.

1363
01:39:46,420 --> 01:39:51,000

That's thoughtful of you.

1364
01:39:56,240 --> 01:39:59,990
KATHERINE - They're lovely.
RUTH - Mr. Harrison's idea really.

1365
01:40:00,520 --> 01:40:02,700
RUTH - Although I suspect his wife did
the picking out.

1366
01:40:03,660 --> 01:40:06,550
RUTH - I can't imagine he has an eye
for anything but numbers..

1367
01:40:07,560 --> 01:40:12,740
RUTH - Now, you have a great wedding.
You did good work around here, Katherine.

1368
01:40:47,100 --> 01:40:50,140
KATHERINE - I don't think I felt a thing
the first time I did this.

1369
01:40:50,380 --> 01:40:52,970
KATHERINE - I was so nervous.

1370
01:40:54,050 --> 01:40:57,990
DOROTHY - This is as beautiful as you were back then.
KATHERINE - You think so?

1371
01:40:58,450 --> 01:41:00,040
DOROTHY - Just a little older.

1372
01:41:00,600 --> 01:41:04,040
MARY - And a little fuller...
But you look good.

1373
01:41:08,565 --> 01:41:10,465
KATHERINE - Here we go. Again.

1374
01:41:20,490 --> 01:41:22,390
DOROTHY - That'a girl

1375
01:41:25,080 --> 01:41:29,079
OTHER - .. And Colonel John Glenn will be
the first American to orbit the Earth.

1376
01:41:29,280 --> 01:41:32,890
OTHER - As you can see, there are thousands of
people here to witness this historic event

1377
01:41:34,570 --> 01:41:38,500
AL HARRISON - Paul, something's off here. These landing
coordinates don't match yesterday's.

1378
01:41:39,900 --> 01:41:42,290
PAUL STAFFORD - The IBM just ran them.

1379
01:41:42,840 --> 01:41:46,760
AL HARRISON - So then the IBM was wrong yesterday, right?

1380
01:41:47,440 --> 01:41:49,310
AL HARRISON - Or the damn thing is wrong today.

1381
01:41:52,720 --> 01:41:56,730
AL HARRISON - Paul, Am I right?
PAUL STAFFORD - It appears so.

1382
01:41:59,778 --> 01:42:02,078
AL HARRISON - The IBM has been spot on up to this point, John.

1383
01:42:02,102 --> 01:42:04,202
AL HARRISON - But we'll run it again,
to see what it comes up with.

1384
01:42:04,590 --> 01:42:08,260
JOHN GLENN - I'll be honest with you, Al
When I fly, I fly the machine,

1385
01:42:08,584 --> 01:42:10,584
JOHN GLENN - Right now, it seems like this machine
is flying me.

1386
01:42:11,130 --> 01:42:13,500
AL HARRISON - We're on the same page, John.
Our guys are on it.

1387
01:42:13,700 --> 01:42:15,770
JOHN GLENN - Let's get the girl to check the numbers.

1388
01:42:15,940 --> 01:42:18,240
AL HARRISON - The girl?

AL HARRISON - You mean Katherine?
JOHN GLENN - Yes, sir. The smart one.

1390
01:42:23,250 --> 01:42:25,630

I'm ready to go.

1391
01:42:26,860 --> 01:42:28,960
AL HARRISON - All right. We'll get into it.
JOHN GLENN - Roger!

1392
01:42:31,260 --> 01:42:34,860
AL HARRISON - Sam!
Go find Katherine Goble.

1393
01:42:34,900 --> 01:42:38,510

1394
01:42:38,580 --> 01:42:40,679
OTHER - Yes, sir.

AL HARRISON - That's right, Colonel.
Katherine did manage to calculate

AL HARRISON - a few decimal points further than that
hunk of metal.

1431

01:49:23,429 --> 01:49:26,244
OTHER - Three quarters of the way
across the African continent.

1459
01:49:26,510 --> 01:49:30,780
OTHER - We see he is currently over Zanzibar, which
is the next tracking station coming up.

1460
01:49:30,860 --> 01:49:32,950
OTHER - Thankfully the Friendship 7 capsule is..

1461
01:49:41,490 --> 01:49:43,450
VIVIAN MITCHELL - New assignment came down the pike.

1462
01:49:46,980 --> 01:49:51,260
VIVIAN MITCHELL - Always changing round here.
It's hard to keep up.

1463
01:49:53,890 --> 01:49:56,680
VIVIAN MITCHELL - Seems like they're gonna need
a permanent team to feed that IBM

1464
01:49:57,520 --> 01:50:00,600
DOROTHY - How big of a team?
VIVIAN MITCHELL - 30 to start.

1465
01:50:03,660 --> 01:50:05,830
DOROTHY - Thank you for the information,
Mrs. Mitchell.

1466
01:50:07,170 --> 01:50:10,480
VIVIAN MITCHELL - You're quite welcome... Mrs. Vaughan.

1467
01:50:55,360 --> 01:50:57,410
JOHN GLENN - We have a warning light!

1468
01:50:57,420 --> 01:50:59,430
JOHN GLENN - Capcom 7,
I have a warning light.

1469
01:50:59,720 --> 01:51:01,080
AL HARRISON - Standby, 7.

1470
01:51:01,530 --> 01:51:02,710
JOHN GLENN - Sir, we have a warning light!

1471
01:51:06,990 --> 01:51:11,268
AL HARRISON - What are we looking at, Paul?
PAUL STAFFORD - The heat shield may have come loose.

1472
01:51:11,293 --> 01:51:15,504
MISSION CONTROL COMMANDER - 7, will you confirm the landing
bag is in the OFF position?

1473
01:51:15,950 --> 01:51:17,670
JOHN GLENN - Affirmative, Capcom.

1474
01:51:18,180 --> 01:51:20,579
PAUL STAFFORD - Al, we need to get him down, now
He could burn up on re-entry.

1475
01:51:30,180 --> 01:51:32,010
MARY - Come on, babies!

1476
01:51:32,130 --> 01:51:35,040
MARY - There's a man in space. We don't want to
miss it, so we gonna home.

1477
01:51:35,064 --> 01:51:36,289
OTHER - Something's wrong with Glenn.

1478
01:51:36,290 --> 01:51:37,760
MARY - Oh, my Goodness!
OTHER - What's going on?

1479
01:51:37,850 --> 01:51:40,190
MARY - Let's go.
MARY - Ya'll follow me.

1480
01:51:41,530 --> 01:51:46,860
OTHER - We've just learned, the Friendship 7
is in danger of losing its heat shield.

1481
01:51:47,010 --> 01:51:50,880
MISSION CONTROL COMMANDER - Have you heard any banging noises?
Or anything of this type at higher rates?

1482
01:51:51,050 --> 01:51:52,430
JOHN GLENN - That's a negative, Capcom.

1483
01:51:54,410 --> 01:51:56,088
KATHERINE - Tell him not to jettison
the retro-package.

1484
01:51:56,413 --> 01:51:58,444
AL HARRISON - Tell him not to jettison
the retro-package.

1485
01:51:58,800 --> 01:52:02,730
OTHER - NASA is confirming there is some sort of
malfunction with the capsule's heat shield,

1486
01:52:02,755 --> 01:52:04,364
OTHER - and it may not stay in place.

1487
01:52:04,690 --> 01:52:10,170
AL HARRISON - If the heat shield is loose... The retro-
package straps might hold it in place.

1488
01:52:10,250 --> 01:52:12,940
PAUL STAFFORD - Will that work?
KATHERINE - It will work.

1489
01:52:13,590 --> 01:52:17,150
KATHERINE - It will hold it until he reaches the
Go /No Go point. It will work!

1490
01:52:18,630 --> 01:52:20,620
OTHER - He has to override the 05g.

1491
01:52:21,420 --> 01:52:23,310
AL HARRISON - Do it.

1492
01:52:23,400 --> 01:52:24,596
MISSION CONTROL COMMANDER - Friendship 7...

1493
01:52:24,621 --> 01:52:29,283
MISSION CONTROL COMMANDER - We're recommending that the retro-package
NOT, I repeat, NOT be jettisoned.

1494
01:52:29,808 --> 01:52:33,670
MISSION CONTROL COMMANDER - This means that you will have
to override the 05g switch.

1495
01:52:33,730 --> 01:52:36,580
JOHN GLENN - Roger!
Is there a reason for this? Over.

1496
01:52:37,350 --> 01:52:38,530
MISSION CONTROL COMMANDER - Standby, 7.

1497
01:52:43,330 --> 01:52:44,520
MISSION CONTROL COMMANDER - Not at this time, 7.

1498
01:52:46,280 --> 01:52:49,850
JOHN GLENN - Roger, that command.
I will make a manual 05g entry,

1499
01:52:50,520 --> 01:52:52,710
JOHN GLENN - and bring the scope in.
Over.

1500
01:52:56,300 --> 01:52:57,960
AL HARRISON - He knows.

1501
01:53:05,565 --> 01:53:08,016
OTHER - Without a heat shield,
there's no way a Colonel Glenn

1502
01:53:08,041 --> 01:53:10,299
OTHER - can get back through
the Earth's atmosphere.

1503
01:53:10,360 --> 01:53:14,635
OTHER - The heat is simply too overpowering.
A malfunction in the automatic control system

1504
01:53:14,881 --> 01:53:17,942
OTHER - is causing the spacecraft to yaw
in a skid like fashion

1505
01:53:18,539 --> 01:53:21,815
OTHER - thus putting the Friendship 7's
re-entry point in jeopardy

1506
01:53:21,915 --> 01:53:25,815
OTHER - even now, col. Glen is
skidding towards the US

1507
01:53:26,290 --> 01:53:28,330
OTHER - and he must begin the retro sequence

1508
01:53:41,450 --> 01:53:44,865
MISSION CONTROL COMMANDER - You're going to be using
fly-by-wire for reentry.

1509
01:53:45,090 --> 01:53:47,573
MISSION CONTROL COMMANDER - You'll need to maintain a zero angle.
Over.

1510
01:53:47,950 --> 01:53:52,170
JOHN GLENN - Roger. I'm on fly-by-wire,
back-it up with manual. Over.

1511
01:53:52,494 --> 01:53:53,879
AL HARRISON - Keep talking to him.

1512
01:53:53,880 --> 01:53:59,550
MISSION CONTROL COMMANDER  - Roger. The weather in the recovery area:
3 foot waves, 10 miles visibility.

1513
01:54:00,540 --> 01:54:02,172
JOHN GLENN - Capcom, you're going out

1514
01:54:02,197 --> 01:54:04,193
PAUL STAFFORD - He's crossing the
communication black-out zone.

1515
01:54:07,218 --> 01:54:10,227
JOHN GLENN - There's a real fireball outside,
and it's getting a little hot here!

1516
01:54:53,870 --> 01:54:55,910
MISSION CONTROL COMMANDER - Friendship 7.
Do you copy? Over.

1517
01:55:00,160 --> 01:55:01,340
AL HARRISON - Again.

1518
01:55:01,710 --> 01:55:03,800
MISSION CONTROL COMMANDER - Friendship 7.
Do you copy? Over.

1519
01:55:18,120 --> 01:55:20,180
MISSION CONTROL COMMANDER - Friendship 7. Do you copy? Over.

1520
01:55:33,620 --> 01:55:35,800
JOHN GLENN - Loud and clear, Capcom.

1521
01:55:35,860 --> 01:55:38,359
MISSION CONTROL COMMANDER - Roger that.
How are you doing?

1522
01:55:40,060 --> 01:55:42,559
JOHN GLENN - My condition is good.
But that was a real fireball, boy

1523
01:55:42,660 --> 01:55:45,760
MISSION CONTROL COMMANDER - Roger that.
Let's get you all the way home.

1524
01:55:45,830 --> 01:55:48,829
MISSION CONTROL COMMANDER - Roger that.
Here's hoping these landing coords still hold.

1525
01:55:48,930 --> 01:55:53,070
MISSION CONTROL COMMANDER - Approaching 16.11984.

1526
01:55:53,620 --> 01:56:01,710
MISSION CONTROL COMMANDER - Roger that!
MISSION CONTROL COMMANDER - Approaching -165.2356. In 3, 2, 1.

1527
01:56:01,750 --> 01:56:03,930
JOHN GLENN - Engaging chutes.

1528
01:56:05,030 --> 01:56:08,329
JOHN GLENN - Beautiful chutes.
How we're lookin, Capcom?

1529
01:56:08,530 --> 01:56:12,870
MISSION CONTROL COMMANDER - Your Go/No Go is good.
Landing coordinates are spot on, 7.

1530
01:56:13,780 --> 01:56:16,070
JOHN GLENN - Roger that, Capcom.

1531
01:56:16,140 --> 01:56:18,939
JOHN GLENN - I've always wanted to swim in
the Bahamas. Over.

1532
01:56:23,140 --> 01:56:26,650
OTHER - John Glenn has splashed-down,
and is being recovered.

1533
01:56:29,430 --> 01:56:34,200
OTHER - John Glenn has splashed-down safely
and is being recovered by USS Noa.

1534
01:56:39,760 --> 01:56:40,760
AL HARRISON - Katherine!

1535
01:56:45,550 --> 01:56:49,270
AL HARRISON - Nice work.
KATHERINE - You too, Mr. Harrison.

1536
01:56:50,550 --> 01:56:51,910
AL HARRISON - So..

1537
01:56:53,130 --> 01:56:55,329
AL HARRISON - You think we can get to the moon?

1538
01:56:57,030 --> 01:57:00,610
KATHERINE - We're already there, sir.

1539
01:57:42,145 --> 01:57:46,339
VIVIAN MITCHELL - Girls..... This is Mrs. Vaughan.
Your supervisor.

1540
01:57:46,564 --> 01:57:50,145
VIVIAN MITCHELL - She'll show you how things work.
DOROTHY - Yeah! Come on in
