546.9: You

547.6: hungry?

547.8: Want
548.4: something
548.6: to
548.7: eat?

548.9: Got
549.1: some
549.4: pasta,
550.1: shrimp,
550.4: lobster.

550.7: I
551.2: got
551.4: whiskey.
551.6: Any
551.9: kind
552.2: of
552.2: booze
552.5: you
552.6: want.

553.4: You
553.8: know
553.9: what?
554.2: The
554.3: Bureau
554.4: does
554.4: not
554.7: allow
554.9: us

555.1: to
555.2: drink
555.3: while
555.4: we
555.5: are
555.6: at
555.9: sea.

556.7: Duh!
556.9: Of
557.1: course.

559.0: Ever
559.1: been
559.2: on
559.4: one
559.5: of
559.6: these
559.8: before?

561.0: A
561.0: boat?

563.0: I
563.1: learned
563.3: how
563.5: to
563.6: sail
563.8: when
564.0: I
564.2: was
564.4: six.

564.5: No
564.8: shit.
565.0: Is
565.2: that
565.4: right?
565.6: Really?

566.6: On
567.2: one
567.2: like
567.5: this,
567.7: though?

568.4: I
568.5: had
568.7: the
568.8: whole
569.0: front
569.4: extended
569.8: in
569.9: order
570.2: to
570.2: fit
570.3: the
570.4: chopper
570.8: up
571.0: there.

571.3: See
571.7: that?

573.9: Anyway,
574.5: this
574.6: is
574.7: for
575.0: you.

575.3: It
575.5: is
575.7: a
575.9: complete
576.1: list
576.3: of
576.5: every
576.7: person
576.9: that
577.1: was
577.3: at
577.5: my
577.7: wedding.

578.9: I
579.1: understand
579.7: you
579.8: wanted
580.0: the
580.1: whole
580.6: wedding
580.8: video.

581.0: Figured
581.7: this
581.8: would
581.9: help
582.0: expedite
582.6: the
582.9: whole
583.0: process,
583.3: right?

584.1: There
584.4: you
584.6: go.
584.8: Look,

585.8: my
586.3: point
586.6: is
586.8: that

586.9: I
587.4: know
587.6: you
587.6: are
587.8: investigating
588.0: Stratton.

589.1: But
589.3: for
589.6: the
589.6: life
589.8: of
590.0: me,
590.2: I
590.3: can
590.3: not
591.5: figure
591.6: out
591.9: why.

592.7: I
593.0: know
593.1: we
593.2: are
593.3: a
593.4: little
593.6: unorthodox,
593.8: we
594.0: are
594.2: a
594.4: little

595.0: loud
595.2: in
595.4: the
595.6: way
595.8: we
596.0: do
596.2: things.
596.4: But
596.6: you
596.8: gotta
597.0: understand,

597.1: we
597.2: are
597.3: the
597.5: new
597.7: guys
597.9: on
598.0: the
598.1: block,
598.3: you
598.5: know,

598.4: we
598.6: are
598.8: trying
599.0: to
599.1: make
599.2: a
599.3: name
599.4: for
599.6: ourselves.

601.2: But
601.4: I
601.6: want
601.8: you
602.0: to
602.2: understand,
602.4: we
602.6: do
602.8: not
