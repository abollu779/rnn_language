2.8: I

3.6: at
3.8: the
4.0: fucking
4.2: beach!

4.0: I
4.1: did
4.3: not
4.6: know
4.8: you

7.3: With
7.5: that
7.7: fucking
7.9: whore
8.1: from
8.3: the

9.0: I
9.2: thought
9.4: you
9.6: were
9.8: at
10.0: the
10.2: beach
10.4: house.

10.6: How
10.8: could

11.2: do
11.4: this
11.6: to
11.8: me?

12.1: Sweetie,

12.7: Who

14.8: You

17.7: I

18.5: I
18.7: do
18.9: not
19.1: know
19.3: what

19.9: you,
20.1: babe.
20.3: I...

21.4: I

21.5: sorry.

22.9: I

35.6: Do
36.0: you
36.1: love
36.2: her?

42.8: Answer
43.4: me.

65.8: I
66.2: felt
66.5: horrible.

68.8: Three
69.2: days
69.5: later,
69.8: I
69.9: filed
70.3: for
70.3: a
70.4: divorce

70.7: and
70.9: moved
71.2: Naomi
71.7: into
71.9: the
72.0: apartment.

77.0: Say

77.9: will,

78.3: but
78.7: the
78.8: Duchess
79.2: did

82.3: feng
82.6: shui
82.7: would
82.9: the

83.3: place.

83.8: She
84.0: even
84.2: hired
84.4: a
84.6: gay
84.8: butler.

86.0: This
86.2: guy
86.4: was
86.6: smart,
86.8: sophisticated,
87.0: professional

88.9: Really,

120.3: In

120.7: bedroom?

120.5: They

121.1: There
121.3: were
121.5: two
121.7: guys

124.1: here.

124.6: There
124.8: were

129.2: Oh,

277.2: name
277.4: for
277.6: me.

278.8: Who

279.2: you
279.4: supposed
279.6: to
279.8: be,
280.0: huh?
280.2: Jack
280.4: Nickle-Jew?

281.2: I
281.3: would
281.5: drive
281.7: the
281.9: price
282.2: up
282.5: then
282.8: he
283.1: would
283.5: sell

283.7: and
283.9: kick
284.1: most
284.3: of
284.5: the
284.7: profits
284.9: back
285.1: to...

286.1: You
286.5: guessed
286.9: it,
286.9: me.

290.6: All
291.1: cash.
291.5: None
292.1: of
292.1: it
292.1: is
292.3: on
292.4: the
292.6: books.

293.2: A
293.3: big
293.7: no-no,
294.0: of
294.3: course,
294.6: in
294.7: the
294.8: eyes
294.9: of
295.0: the
295.2: law.

296.4: Enter
296.7: our
297.1: new
297.3: securities
297.9: attorney,
298.4: Manny
299.0: Riskin.

300.1: 700
301.0: bucks
301.1: an
301.4: hour
301.5: to
301.8: be
301.9: the
302.0: voice
302.2: of
303.0: doom.

303.3: Listen
303.6: to
303.7: me.
303.8: You
304.0: piss
304.3: up
304.4: the
304.6: SEC's
304.8: leg,

305.1: you
305.2: end
305.4: up
305.6: with
305.8: your
305.9: tits
306.1: in
306.2: a
306.4: ringer.

306.5: Do
306.8: not
307.0: worry
307.3: about
307.4: it.
307.7: I
307.8: have
307.9: the
308.1: SEC
308.3: under
308.5: control.

310.0: What
310.3: the
310.5: fuck
311.0: are
311.0: these
311.2: imbeciles
311.4: doing?

312.4: Hey!
312.6: Hey!

313.7: What
314.3: are
314.4: you
314.5: doing?
314.7: Hey!

315.3: We
315.5: got
315.7: the
315.9: SEC
316.1: in
316.3: here.

317.3: The
317.8: Securities
318.4: and
318.5: Exchange
319.1: Commission

319.4: sent
319.7: two
320.0: lawyers
320.5: down
320.8: to
320.9: review
321.2: our
321.3: files.

322.2: So
322.5: I
322.6: set
322.8: them
323.0: up
323.2: in
323.3: our
323.3: conference
323.8: room

324.2: and
324.5: I
324.6: had
324.8: it
325.0: bugged

325.1: and
325.8: the
325.9: air
326.1: conditioning
326.7: turned
326.9: up
327.1: so
327.3: high

327.8: that
328.0: it
328.2: felt
328.4: like
328.6: Antarctica
328.8: in
329.0: there.

329.2: Is
329.4: it
329.6: always
329.8: this
330.0: cold
330.2: in
330.4: here?

331.3: I
331.6: do
331.6: not
331.8: know.

332.1: Then,
332.3: while
332.5: they
332.7: were
332.9: looking

333.8: for
333.9: a
334.0: smoking
334.5: gun
334.7: in
334.9: that
335.1: room...

335.1: Arncliffe
335.3: International
335.5: is
335.7: on
335.9: fire.

337.4: I
337.9: was
338.1: gonna
338.3: fire
338.6: off
338.9: a
339.0: bazooka
339.6: in
339.7: here,

340.4: offering
341.1: up
341.2: our
341.4: latest
341.9: IPO.

342.7: An
343.2: IPO
343.8: is
344.0: an
344.2: initial
344.5: public
344.7: offering.

345.3: It
345.4: is
345.6: the
345.8: first
346.1: time
346.3: a
346.5: stock
346.7: is
346.9: offered
347.3: for
347.4: sale
347.7: to
347.8: the
348.0: general
348.1: population.

349.1: Now,
349.3: as
349.5: the
349.7: firm
350.0: taking
350.2: the
350.4: company
350.8: public,

351.0: we
351.4: set
351.9: the
352.0: initial
352.3: sales
352.6: price

352.8: then
353.1: sold
353.4: those
353.6: shares
353.6: right
354.1: back
354.3: to
354.4: our
354.5: friends.
354.7: The...

355.8: Look.

357.4: I
357.6: know
357.8: you
358.0: are
358.2: not
358.4: following
358.6: what
358.8: I
359.0: am
359.2: saying
359.4: anyway,
359.6: right?

359.4: That
359.7: is
360.3: okay.
360.5: That
360.8: does
360.8: not
361.1: matter.

361.4: The
361.5: real
362.0: question
362.4: is
362.6: this.

363.3: "Was
363.8: all
364.0: this
364.2: legal?"

365.5: Absolutely
366.4: fucking
366.7: not.

367.6: But
367.8: we
368.0: were
368.2: making
368.4: more
368.7: money
368.8: than
368.9: we
369.0: knew
369.1: what
369.3: to
369.5: do
369.7: with.

374.4: And
374.5: what
374.6: do
374.8: you
374.9: do
375.1: when
375.3: you
375.5: are
375.7: making

375.6: more
375.8: money
376.1: than
376.2: you
376.3: know
376.4: what
376.5: to
376.6: do
376.7: with?

383.0: Oh,
383.3: my
383.5: God!

384.9: Will
385.1: you
385.2: marry
385.5: me?

387.0: Oh,
387.2: my
387.4: God.

388.3: Is
388.8: that
389.0: a
389.1: yes?

391.2: Are
391.6: you
391.7: sure?

392.2: Yeah,
392.4: I
392.6: am
392.8: sure.
393.0: Yeah,
393.2: I
393.4: am
393.6: sure.

394.4: Are
394.5: you
394.9: sure?
395.1: Yeah.

406.7: I
406.9: held
407.2: my
407.4: bachelor
408.0: party
408.2: at
408.5: the
408.5: Mirage
409.3: in
409.4: Las
409.5: Vegas.

410.2: The
410.5: flight
410.8: there
411.2: alone
411.5: was
411.8: a
412.0: bacchanal.

412.8: One
413.3: last
413.6: blowout
414.2: for
414.4: the
414.6: gods

414.5: before
415.2: I
415.4: settled
415.7: down
415.8: for
416.0: good.

417.1: A
417.3: hundred
417.5: Strattonites,

418.6: 50
418.8: hookers,
419.0: plus
419.2: 50
419.4: more
419.6: waiting
419.8: once
420.0: we
420.2: landed.

422.1: Oh,
422.3: and
422.5: the
422.7: drugs.

423.2: I
423.7: mean,
423.9: I
424.2: tell
424.5: you,
424.7: our
424.9: plane
425.3: was
425.7: like
425.8: a
425.8: pharmacy
426.5: with
426.7: wings.

456.7: All
457.1: told,
457.6: the
458.2: weekend
458.6: cost
458.9: me
459.1: 2
459.3: million
459.6: bucks,

461.4: including
461.6: the
461.9: cost
462.4: of
462.5: refurbishing
462.8: the
463.1: entire
463.5: 28th
464.1: floor.

466.3: kiss
466.5: the
466.7: bride.

469.4: Ah!
469.8: But
470.2: the
470.4: wedding

471.1: was
471.2: something
471.7: out
471.8: of
471.9: a
472.1: fairy
472.4: tale.

473.7: With
473.9: Naomi,
474.1: my
474.3: Duchess,

476.2: me,
476.7: her
476.9: handsome
477.3: Duke,

477.7: and
478.0: The
478.0: Bahamas
478.9: Ocean
479.1: Club,
479.3: our
479.5: castle.

491.8: Of
492.0: course,
492.2: after
492.4: the
492.6: bachelor
493.1: party,
493.3: me,
493.5: the
493.7: Duke,

494.4: needed
495.3: a
495.4: few
495.6: penicillin
496.1: shots
496.7: so
496.9: he
497.1: could

497.4: safely
498.1: consummate
498.7: the
498.9: marriage.

504.9: Hey!
505.3: Barry
505.6: Kleinman,
505.7: filming
505.9: the
506.1: wedding.

506.9: A
507.0: few
507.2: words

507.6: your
507.8: son?

508.3: Jordan.
508.5: Remember
508.7: what
508.9: I
509.1: told
509.3: you.

511.1: It
511.3: involves
511.5: your
511.7: penis
511.9: and
512.1: her
512.3: vagina.

514.3: And
514.5: you
514.7: know,
514.9: you
515.1: know
515.3: what
515.5: you
515.7: can
515.9: do,
516.1: Jordy.

534.7: Oh,

536.1: Aunt
536.3: Emma?

541.6: I

542.6: came!

544.1: Jordan!
544.3: Jordan!
544.5: Look

551.4: lovely.
551.5: Hey,
552.0: how
552.6: you
552.8: doing?

554.6: It
554.7: is
554.8: a
554.9: pleasure
555.1: to
555.3: finally
555.5: meet
555.7: you
555.9: in
556.1: person.

557.7: Into
557.9: the
558.1: donuts,
558.3: I
558.5: see.

559.4: Oh,

566.2: Enjoy

568.0: She

568.4: me.
568.6: I

584.8: more
585.0: step.
585.2: Are
