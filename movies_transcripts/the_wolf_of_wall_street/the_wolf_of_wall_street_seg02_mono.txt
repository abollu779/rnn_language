3.5: addicted.

4.9: And
5.3: you
5.4: just

5.6: doing
6.0: this,
6.2: again
6.4: and
6.6: again
6.8: and

27.3: keys
27.5: to
27.7: success
27.9: in
28.1: the

47.3: Three
47.5: or

47.9: times,
48.1: maybe
48.3: five.

48.7: Gotta
48.9: pump
49.1: those
49.3: numbers
49.5: up.

49.6: Those
50.0: are
50.1: rookie
50.2: numbers
50.4: in
50.8: this
51.0: racket.

52.1: I

63.0: That
63.1: is
63.6: not
63.7: why
63.8: I
64.0: do
64.2: it.

64.7: I
65.0: do
65.1: it
65.2: 'cause
65.3: I
65.5: fucking
65.8: need
66.1: to.

67.8: Think
68.1: about
68.3: it.
68.6: You
68.6: are
68.6: dealing
68.8: with
69.1: numbers.

69.6: All

85.1: flowing.

84.6: Mmm-hmm.

85.5: I
85.8: keep
85.9: the
86.1: rhythm
86.3: below
86.6: the
87.0: belt.

87.8: Done.

88.8: This
89.0: is
89.2: not
89.3: a
89.4: tip,
89.6: this
89.8: is
90.0: a
90.2: prescription.

90.7: Trust
91.0: me.
91.2: Mmm-hmm.

91.4: If
91.6: you

98.6: implode.

99.9: No,
100.4: I

553.5: little
553.5: downside
553.7: risk.

556.1: Okay,
556.5: great.
556.9: The
557.3: reason
557.6: for
557.7: the
557.9: call
558.1: today,
558.4: John,
558.9: is,

559.6: something
560.3: just

560.9: across
561.1: my
561.5: desk,
561.6: John.

562.2: It
562.6: is
562.7: perhaps
562.9: the
563.2: best
563.4: thing

563.9: I
563.9: have
564.2: seen
564.4: in
564.6: the
564.6: last
564.8: six
565.0: months.

565.6: If
565.6: you
565.7: have
565.8: 60
566.3: seconds,
566.7: I
566.7: would
566.8: like
567.0: to
567.2: share

567.0: the
567.4: idea
567.8: with
568.0: you.
568.2: You
568.4: got
568.6: a
568.8: minute?

568.3: Actually,
568.5: I
568.7: am
568.9: really
569.1: very...

569.4: The
569.6: name
569.8: of
570.0: the
570.2: company,
570.4: Aerotyne
570.6: International.

572.1: It
572.2: is
572.4: a
572.6: cutting
572.9: edge
573.2: high-tech
574.1: firm
574.5: out
574.6: of
574.7: the
574.8: Midwest

575.5: awaiting
576.2: imminent
576.9: patent
577.1: approval

577.8: on
577.9: the
578.1: next
578.5: generation
579.1: of
579.2: radar
579.4: detectors

580.3: that
580.4: have
580.6: both
580.8: huge
581.3: military
581.7: and
582.4: civilian
583.0: applications
583.8: now.

584.6: Right
585.1: now,
585.4: John,

585.9: the
586.1: stock
586.3: trades
586.5: over-the-counter
586.7: at
586.9: 10
587.1: cents
587.3: a
587.5: share.

588.4: And
588.6: by
588.8: the
589.0: way,
589.2: John,
589.4: our
589.6: analysts
589.8: indicate

590.8: it
591.1: could
591.3: go
591.4: a
591.6: heck
592.0: of
592.0: a
592.1: lot
592.2: higher
592.5: than
592.7: that.

593.0: Your
593.7: profit
593.9: on
594.2: a
594.5: mere
594.8: $6,000
595.0: investment

596.5: would
596.6: be
596.7: upwards
597.2: of
597.2: $60,000!

599.3: Jesus!
599.5: That
599.7: is
599.9: my
600.1: mortgage,
600.3: man.

600.6: Exactly.
601.4: You
601.5: could
601.7: pay
601.8: off
602.0: your
602.2: mortgage.

602.5: This
602.7: stock
602.9: will
603.1: pay
603.3: off
603.5: my
603.7: house?
