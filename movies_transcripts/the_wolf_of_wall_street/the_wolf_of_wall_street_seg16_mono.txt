148.5: she
148.7: probably
148.9: will
148.9: not
149.2: wave

150.2: Naomi,
150.8: sweetheart!

159.8: in
160.0: order

166.2: buddy,
166.6: to

172.1: That
172.3: is
172.5: more
172.7: important.

173.4: How's
173.9: morale?

174.7: They

198.2: All
198.4: right.

199.4: I
199.6: love

200.0: buddy.

200.5: You

201.2: right?
201.4: I
201.6: know.

202.5: You
202.6: know
202.8: that,
203.0: right?
203.2: I
203.4: know.

205.4: I
205.6: could

206.6: over.

206.5: All
206.7: right,

207.1: enough.

209.9: You
210.1: want
210.3: a
210.5: beer,
210.7: pal?

211.1: What
211.3: are
211.5: you
211.7: drinking?

212.2: I
212.6: got
212.8: this
212.9: non-alcoholic
214.0: shit.

214.6: What
214.6: is
215.0: that?

215.9: A
216.1: non-alcoholic
216.3: beer.
216.5: It
216.7: has
216.9: got
217.1: no
217.3: alcohol.

219.0: It
219.2: is
219.4: a
219.6: beer?
219.8: Yeah,
220.0: with
220.2: no
220.4: alcohol.

221.7: But
221.9: if
222.1: you
222.3: drink
222.5: enough,

223.2: if
223.3: you
223.4: drink
223.5: a
223.7: lot,

225.2: No,
225.3: there

225.9: alcohol.
226.1: That
226.3: is
226.5: the
226.7: fucking
227.1: point.

227.6: I
227.6: am
227.8: not
228.0: a
228.2: scientist.

228.5: I
228.7: do
228.9: not
229.1: know
229.3: what
229.5: the
229.7: fuck
229.9: you
230.1: are
230.3: talking
230.5: about.

229.5: I
229.6: can
229.7: get
229.8: you
229.9: a
230.0: beer
230.2: if
230.4: you
230.6: want
230.8: a
231.0: fucking
231.2: beer.

231.4: I
231.4: know,

231.4: not
231.8: drink.
232.1: You
232.3: remember?

233.6: I
233.6: do
233.6: not
234.1: drink
234.3: anymore.

234.9: Oh,
235.2: you
235.3: wanna
235.5: go
235.6: inside

236.0: and
236.2: blow
236.4: some
236.6: lines
236.8: of
237.0: baking
237.2: powder?

237.5: Or
237.7: baking
237.9: soda...

239.2: Can
239.4: not
239.6: imagine
239.7: ever
240.0: not
240.4: enjoying
240.9: getting
241.0: fucked
241.4: up.

241.8: Yeah.
242.2: I
242.4: love
242.7: it.

243.3: How's
243.6: being
243.9: sober?

244.9: Fucking
245.5: sucks.
245.9: Boring,
246.1: right?

246.9: So
247.1: boring.
247.3: I
247.5: wanna
247.7: kill
247.9: myself.

249.8: There
250.0: is
250.2: a
250.4: term,
250.6: and
250.8: we
251.0: do
251.2: not
251.4: like
251.6: to
251.8: use
252.0: it

252.5: unless
252.8: circumstances
253.0: dictate,

254.0: and
254.2: I
254.4: think
254.6: they
254.8: do
255.0: dictate
255.2: in
255.4: this
255.6: case,

256.0: and
256.2: the
256.3: term
256.7: is
256.9: "Grenada."

257.3: Have
257.5: you
257.5: ever
257.6: heard
257.7: of
257.8: Grenada?

259.1: No.
259.3: No,
259.5: I
259.7: have.
259.9: not

260.1: Grenada's
260.6: very
260.8: interesting
261.3: because

261.9: it
262.1: is
262.3: a
262.5: small
262.7: island
262.9: nation

264.1: that
264.2: was
264.4: invaded
265.0: by
265.0: the
265.2: United
265.3: States
265.8: of
266.1: America
266.6: in
266.7: 1983.

267.6: It
267.7: is
267.8: about
267.9: 90,000
268.7: people.

269.7: And
269.9: essentially,
270.1: it
270.3: means

272.6: this
273.1: case
273.3: is
273.5: unloseable.

275.1: Okay?

275.7: So,
276.2: you
276.8: know,
276.9: we
277.1: can
277.2: come
277.4: in,

277.4: we
277.8: can
277.9: have
278.0: our
278.1: dick
278.5: hanging
278.8: out
279.0: of
279.1: our
279.2: pants.

279.4: Nobody
280.1: gives
280.3: a
280.4: fuck.

280.7: I
280.7: am
281.0: gonna
281.3: win.

282.4: You,
282.9: sir.

285.4: Are
285.6: what
285.8: is
286.0: known

288.0: as
288.4: a
288.6: Grenada.

289.5: Hmm.

292.5: You
292.5: are
293.0: looking
293.3: at
293.4: real
293.7: prison
294.7: time.

295.0: Hmm.

295.9: Money
296.4: laundering
296.7: can
297.0: get
297.1: you
297.2: as
297.4: much
297.5: as
297.7: 20
298.1: years.

299.2: And
299.9: our
300.5: case
300.8: could
300.8: not
301.1: be
301.2: stronger
301.5: if
301.8: we
302.0: caught
302.2: you

302.1: shoving
302.6: cash
303.0: in
303.2: your
303.3: mattress.

303.9: Is
304.1: that
304.4: right?

305.8: Hey,
306.0: Jordan.
306.2: Jordan.

308.9: Your
309.4: rotting
309.8: away
309.9: in
310.1: jail
310.5: till
310.7: your
311.0: kids
311.2: get
311.6: out
311.7: of
311.8: college,

312.8: that
312.8: is
313.3: not
313.5: our
313.7: ambition
314.2: here.

315.9: There
315.9: is
316.4: other
316.5: people
316.7: involved
317.1: in
317.4: this,
317.5: too.

318.5: We
318.9: think
319.1: they
319.3: need
319.5: to
319.6: see
319.7: their
319.9: day
320.1: in
320.3: court
320.3: as
320.7: well.

324.1: Why
324.5: do
324.6: I
324.7: sense
324.8: there
325.0: is
325.2: an
325.3: offer
325.6: in
325.7: the
325.8: air?

326.3: Look
326.4: at
326.5: him.
326.6: He
326.8: has
326.9: got
327.0: a
327.1: sense.
327.3: What
328.2: are
328.3: you,

339.4: you
339.5: just
339.6: say
339.8: "wear
340.0: a
340.2: wire"?

340.8: A
341.0: wire.
341.2: Mmm-hmm.

342.1: What
342.3: does
342.5: that
342.7: mean?

343.5: You
343.5: want
343.5: me
343.6: to
344.0: rat?
344.4: Is
344.6: that
344.8: it?

345.5: No,
345.7: I
345.9: want
346.1: you
346.3: to
346.5: cooperate.

346.8: No.
346.8: You
346.8: want
346.9: me
346.9: to
346.9: rat,
347.0: right?
347.4: Yes.
347.8: We
348.0: want
348.2: you
348.4: to
348.6: rat.

348.8: That
348.9: is
349.1: fucking
349.4: exactly
350.0: what
350.2: we
350.4: want
350.6: you
350.7: to
350.8: do.
351.0: To
351.3: rat.

356.8: How
357.1: was
357.4: Cristy's
357.7: party?

358.7: Fine.

359.9: Good.

362.2: Babe,
362.8: I
362.9: spoke
363.2: to
363.3: the
363.4: lawyers
363.8: again
364.1: today.

364.9: I
365.1: have
365.3: some
365.5: really,
365.7: really
365.9: great
366.1: news.

367.7: Mmm-hmm.

369.3: Turns
369.8: out
369.9: you
370.0: are
370.1: completely
370.6: off
370.8: the
371.0: hook,
371.2: honey.

373.0: I
373.3: know
373.5: that
373.7: already.

374.6: Right.
375.1: Exactly.

376.4: You
376.6: never
376.8: did
377.0: anything
377.2: wrong
377.4: in
377.6: the
377.8: first
378.0: place,
378.2: right?

380.3: It
380.8: turns
381.0: out,
381.1: all
381.5: the
381.8: FBI
382.2: really

383.2: wants
383.7: from
383.9: me
384.0: is
384.1: to,
384.3: uh,

385.5: to
385.5: cooperate.

387.2: You
387.4: know?

388.5: Turns
389.0: out
389.0: I
389.1: have
389.2: so
389.3: much
389.5: information

390.0: about
390.1: the
390.3: stock
390.6: market
390.9: and
391.2: Wall
391.2: Street,

391.7: I
391.8: could
392.0: save
392.3: the
392.4: government

392.6: years
393.1: of
393.2: heartache,
393.5: not
393.8: to
394.0: mention

394.7: countless
395.4: dollars.
395.6: Mmm-hmm.

397.6: But
397.8: it
398.0: gets
398.2: even
398.4: better,
398.6: babe.

400.4: Because
400.9: if
401.0: I
401.0: do
401.5: decide
401.7: to
402.1: cooperate,

403.3: I
403.6: might
403.9: only
404.0: be
404.2: looking
404.5: at
404.8: four
405.1: short
405.5: years,

406.2: in
406.2: which
406.7: case,
406.9: you
407.1: know,

407.8: we
408.2: could
408.3: start
408.6: fresh,
409.0: maybe
409.5: sell
409.9: the
410.0: house.

410.9: And
411.2: any
411.5: fines
411.8: that
411.8: I
411.8: would
412.1: have
412.2: to
412.4: pay

412.6: would
412.6: not
412.9: be
413.0: due
413.2: till
413.4: after
413.5: I
413.8: serve
414.1: my
414.3: term,

414.5: so
414.7: we
414.7: would
414.8: still
415.1: have
415.2: plenty
415.3: of
415.4: money
415.8: left
416.2: over,
416.3: you
416.6: know?

416.9: Mmm-hmm.

419.5: The
419.7: only
419.9: thing
420.1: that
420.3: of
420.5: course
420.7: bummed
420.9: me
421.1: out
421.3: a
421.5: little
421.7: bit

421.8: is
422.2: this
422.3: whole
422.6: idea
423.2: of
423.4: having
423.6: to

424.9: give
425.3: information
425.5: about
426.0: my
426.3: friends.

427.0: Like
427.6: you
427.8: said,
428.0: "There's
428.2: no
428.4: friends
428.7: on
428.9: Wall
429.1: Street."
429.3: Right?

430.4: Right.
430.6: Right.
430.8: Exactly.

432.4: There
432.6: is
432.8: a
433.0: silver
433.2: lining
433.4: to
433.6: that,
433.8: too,
434.0: honey.

433.9: Because
434.4: they
434.6: said
434.6: eventually...

435.9: Eventually
436.5: everyone's
436.8: gonna
437.2: have
437.3: to
437.5: give
437.6: information
437.8: on
438.4: this
438.5: case.

438.9: So,
439.0: at
439.1: the
439.2: end
439.3: of
439.4: the
439.5: day,
439.5: it
439.6: might
439.8: not
440.0: even
440.1: be
440.2: a
440.4: factor.
440.6: You
440.8: know?

441.7: Well,
441.7: that
441.7: is
442.3: good
442.5: news.
442.6: Right?

443.9: Yeah,
444.1: yeah.

445.8: I
445.8: am
445.8: really
446.3: happy
446.6: for
446.8: you.

449.0: mean,
449.1: happy
450.8: for
451.0: me,
451.2: sweetheart?

453.0: You
453.1: should
453.4: be
453.6: happy
453.8: for
454.0: the
454.0: both

454.4: us.
454.6: Right?

455.7: Yeah,

456.1: All
456.3: right.

459.8: Come
