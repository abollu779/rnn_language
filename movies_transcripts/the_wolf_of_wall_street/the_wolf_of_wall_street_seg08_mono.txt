258.7: Ah,
258.7: yes,
259.8: my
260.1: morning
260.3: ritual.

261.0: First
261.8: I
261.8: would
262.0: get
262.2: up
262.3: and
262.4: fight
262.8: with
262.9: Naomi

263.4: about
263.6: whatever
263.8: it
264.1: is
264.1: I
264.3: did
264.5: the
264.6: night
264.8: before.

265.6: Next
266.2: was
266.4: a
266.5: steam
266.9: so
267.2: I
267.3: could
267.5: sweat
267.9: out

268.0: the
268.2: drugs
268.6: still
268.8: in
269.0: my
269.1: system.

269.6: Then
270.0: I
270.0: would
270.1: assess
270.5: the
270.7: damage.

271.4: Drown
271.9: out
272.0: my
272.1: eyeballs.

273.5: Take
274.0: my
274.2: "back
274.4: pills"
274.7: to
275.1: get
275.3: the
275.4: day
275.5: started,

275.8: then
276.5: seek
276.9: to
277.1: make
277.3: up
277.5: with
277.6: Naomi.

278.4: Good
278.9: morning,
279.5: Daddy.

280.7: Where
280.7: is
281.2: my
281.5: kiss?

282.6: Whee!

284.3: Hey,
284.5: sweetheart.

287.6: Does
287.8: Daddy
288.0: get
288.2: a
288.4: kiss
288.6: from
288.8: both
289.0: of
289.2: his
289.4: little
289.6: girls,
289.8: huh?

290.4: Oh,
290.9: no.

292.2: No,
292.6: Daddy
293.2: does
293.2: not
293.6: even
293.9: get
294.1: to
294.3: touch
294.5: Mommy

295.1: for
295.8: a
296.0: very,
296.2: very,

297.6: very
298.2: long
298.5: time.

299.3: Daddy's
299.9: really
300.2: sorry
300.9: about
301.0: what
301.4: he
301.4: said
301.7: in
301.8: the
301.8: other
302.1: room.

302.2: He
302.4: did
302.4: not
302.7: mean
302.9: any
303.2: of
303.3: it.

303.3: Daddy
304.2: should
304.2: not
304.6: waste
304.8: his
305.2: time.

306.4: And
306.4: from
306.8: now
307.3: on,

309.3: it
309.5: is
309.7: gonna
309.9: be
310.1: nothing
310.3: but
310.5: short,

312.0: short
312.5: skirts
313.1: around
313.4: the
313.6: house.

316.6: And
316.9: you
317.2: know
317.5: something
317.8: else,
318.0: Daddy?

320.3: Mommy
321.3: is
321.6: just
322.0: so
322.4: sick
323.2: and
