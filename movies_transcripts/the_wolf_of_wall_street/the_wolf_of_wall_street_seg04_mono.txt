1.0: and
1.4: in
1.5: no
1.7: time,
2.2: I
2.2: will
2.8: make
3.1: them
3.4: rich.

6.1: Oh,
6.5: my
6.8: God.

7.7: Jordan,
7.9: that...

9.1: You
9.2: like
9.5: it,
9.9: baby?

10.0: Oh,
10.9: my
11.2: God,
11.3: it
11.4: is
11.5: beautiful.

12.7: They
12.9: are
13.1: not
13.3: the
13.5: biggest
13.8: stones
14.3: in
14.3: the
14.4: world,

14.4: but
15.0: I
15.1: promise
15.2: they
15.3: are
15.5: really
15.8: high
15.9: quality.

16.7: It
16.9: is
17.1: beautiful.

18.2: They
18.6: are
19.1: so
19.3: beautiful.

20.5: Oh,
20.7: boy.

22.0: What?

23.1: I
23.6: know
24.1: that
24.6: look.
25.1: What
25.5: is
25.6: it?
25.8: Go
26.0: ahead.

25.7: I
25.9: do
26.1: not
26.3: know,
26.5: it's...
26.7: You
26.9: know...

27.9: These
28.1: stocks...
28.3: These
28.5: companies...

30.8: They
30.8: are
30.8: like
30.9: crappy
31.9: companies.

32.4: Well,
32.8: yeah.
33.0: Okay.

33.9: Yeah,
34.1: they
34.3: are
34.5: terrible.

36.1: Do
36.2: not
36.4: worry
36.6: about
36.8: it.
37.0: I
37.1: told
37.2: you,

37.4: what
37.5: I
37.7: am
37.8: doing
38.0: is
38.2: completely
38.4: legal.

38.9: Yeah,
39.1: I
39.3: know.

39.9: But
40.0: they
40.1: are
40.2: not
40.4: gonna
40.7: make
40.9: anyone
41.1: money
41.2: though,
41.6: right?

42.9: Well,
43.1: sometimes
43.3: they
43.5: do,
43.7: sometimes
43.9: they
44.1: do.
44.3: not

45.1: You
45.3: know
45.5: how
45.7: it
45.9: goes.

46.7: Would
46.9: not
47.2: you
47.5: feel
47.5: better
47.9: if
48.0: you
48.3: sold
48.5: that
48.7: stuff
48.9: to
49.1: rich
49.3: people

49.5: who
49.6: can,
49.8: like,
49.9: afford
50.1: to
50.2: lose
50.4: all
50.5: that
50.7: money?

53.4: Of
53.8: course.

55.5: But
55.5: rich
56.1: people
56.3: do
56.3: not
56.5: buy
56.7: penny
57.0: stocks.

58.2: They
58.4: just
58.6: do.
58.8: not

60.0: Why
60.4: not?

63.5: Because
64.1: they
64.1: are
64.2: too
64.5: smart,

65.1: that
65.3: is
65.5: why
65.7: not.

66.6: I
66.9: mean,
67.1: what
67.4: person
67.8: with
67.9: a
67.9: college
68.5: education

69.5: would
69.8: trust
70.3: this
70.4: bunch
70.7: of
70.9: jerk-offs?

70.9: Hang
71.1: up
71.3: the
71.5: phone.
71.7: Tell
71.9: him
72.1: you
72.3: will
72.5: call
72.7: him
72.9: back.

72.1: I
72.3: got
72.5: 5
72.7: fucking
72.9: grand
73.1: on
73.3: the
73.5: phone
73.7: right
73.9: now!

73.3: Hey!

74.7: But
75.1: what
75.1: if
75.2: they
75.5: did
75.5: not
75.8: sound
76.1: like
76.2: a
76.4: bunch
76.6: of
76.8: jerk-offs?

77.6: What
78.1: if
78.1: I
78.2: could
78.4: teach
78.7: them
78.9: how
79.1: to
79.3: sell
79.5: to
79.8: people
80.2: with
80.3: money?

81.4: Real
82.0: money.

83.3: So
83.6: I
83.7: decided
84.1: to
84.2: reinvent
84.6: the
84.7: company.

85.4: Gentlemen,
86.2: welcome

88.3: to
88.7: Stratton
89.4: Oakmont.

90.6: You

92.6: the
92.7: wealthiest
93.3: 1%
94.5: of
94.9: Americans.

115.8: motherfucker.
116.1: From
116.3: the
116.5: book.

121.2: We
121.4: are
121.6: a
121.8: new
122.0: company
122.2: with
122.4: a
122.6: new
122.8: name.

123.7: A
124.0: company
124.6: that
124.6: our
124.8: clients
125.5: can
125.9: believe
126.4: in.

127.1: A
127.3: company
127.5: that
127.7: our
127.9: clients
128.1: can
128.3: trust.

130.2: A
130.5: firm
131.0: whose
131.2: roots
131.7: are
132.3: so
132.7: deeply
133.2: embedded
133.6: into
133.8: Wall
134.2: Street

134.5: that
134.7: our
135.0: very
135.3: founders
136.3: sailed
137.2: over
137.4: on
137.6: the
137.7: Mayflower

138.1: and
138.4: chiseled
138.8: the
139.0: name
139.3: Stratton
139.5: Oakmont

140.0: right
140.2: into
140.4: Plymouth
140.6: fucking
140.8: Rock!

142.5: You
142.5: got
143.0: it?

144.2: What
144.4: we
144.6: are
144.8: gonna
145.0: do
145.2: is
145.4: this.

146.1: First
146.6: we
146.8: pitch
147.0: 'em
147.3: Disney,
147.8: AT&T,
148.6: IBM,

149.1: blue
149.8: chip
150.1: stocks
150.6: exclusively.

151.1: Companies
152.2: these
152.3: people
152.5: know.

153.9: Once
154.1: we
154.3: have
154.6: suckered
154.8: them
155.1: in,
155.5: we
155.9: unload
156.4: the
156.6: dog
156.8: shit.

157.7: The
158.1: pink
158.5: sheets,
158.8: the
159.2: penny
159.4: stocks,

159.9: where
160.6: we
160.8: make
161.0: the
161.1: money.

161.6: 50%
162.7: commission,
163.3: baby.
163.5: Ooh.

164.1: Now
164.5: the
164.6: key
164.9: to
165.0: making
165.1: money
165.6: in
165.7: a
165.8: situation
166.4: like
166.5: this

166.9: is
167.2: to
167.5: position
167.7: yourself
168.4: now
168.6: before
169.2: the
169.3: settlement.

170.0: Because
170.0: by
170.3: the
170.7: time
171.0: you
171.2: read
171.4: about
171.5: it
171.7: in
171.7: The
171.8: Wall
172.1: Street
172.2: Journal,

172.9: it
172.9: is
173.3: already
173.7: too
174.4: late.

175.4: Then
175.8: you
175.9: wait.

177.4: You
177.7: wait.

178.2: And
178.3: whoever
179.0: speaks
179.5: first
179.6: loses.

182.9: Sorry,
183.1: uh...

184.3: I
184.5: appreciate
184.7: the
184.9: call.

185.6: I
186.2: really
186.7: have
187.2: to
187.3: give
187.4: this
187.5: some
187.6: thought

188.2: and
188.4: talk
188.6: to
188.8: my
189.0: wife
189.2: about
189.4: it.

190.1: Can
190.3: I
190.5: call
190.7: you
190.9: back?

191.4: They
191.4: do
191.4: not
191.5: know,
191.6: right?
191.9: They
192.2: gotta
192.5: think
192.7: about
192.9: it,

192.8: they
193.0: gotta
193.2: talk
193.5: to
193.6: their
193.8: fucking
194.0: wives,
194.2: or
194.4: the
194.6: fucking
194.8: Tooth
195.0: Fairy.

195.3: Point
195.9: is,
195.9: it
196.0: does
196.0: not
196.1: matter
196.4: what
196.5: the
196.6: fuck
196.8: they
196.9: say.

197.0: The
197.5: only
197.7: real
197.9: objection
198.1: that
198.4: they
198.7: have
199.0: is
199.1: that
199.2: they
199.3: do
199.3: not
199.3: trust
199.7: you
200.0: guys.

200.8: And
200.8: why
201.3: should
201.6: they
201.7: trust
201.8: you?
202.0: I
202.1: mean,
202.3: look
202.5: at
202.7: you.

202.8: You
202.8: are
202.8: a
202.9: bunch
203.2: of
203.3: fucking
203.5: sleazy
203.7: salesmen,
203.9: right?

205.2: So,
206.0: what
206.9: do
207.0: you
207.0: say?

207.1: You
207.3: mean
207.5: to
207.7: tell
207.9: me
208.1: that
208.3: if
208.5: I
208.7: put
208.9: you
209.1: in
209.3: at
209.5: Union
209.7: Carbide
209.9: at
210.1: 7

210.3: and
210.5: took
210.7: you
210.9: out
211.1: at
211.3: 32...

211.7: Texas
212.2: Instruments
212.5: at
212.8: 11
213.2: and
213.5: took
213.6: you
213.7: out
213.9: at
214.1: 47...

214.5: U.S.
214.7: Steel
214.9: at
215.1: 16,
215.3: took
215.5: you
215.7: out
215.9: at
216.1: 41...

217.2: You
217.3: would
217.4: not
217.5: be
217.6: saying
217.7: to
217.8: me
217.9: right
218.1: now,
218.3: "Chester,

218.8: "pick
219.2: me
219.3: up
219.4: a
219.5: few
219.7: thousand
220.0: shares
220.4: of
220.6: Disney

220.7: "on
220.9: the
221.2: spot,
221.6: right
221.7: now.
221.9: Come
222.1: on."

222.8: Honestly,
223.0: Kevin?
223.2: Honestly?
223.4: Seriously?

224.1: I
225.0: do
225.0: not
225.3: know
225.5: you.

225.7: You
225.9: cold-called
226.1: me.
226.3: You
226.5: are
226.7: a
226.9: total
227.1: stranger.

228.0: I
228.1: am
228.3: in
228.4: complete
228.7: agreement
228.9: with
229.1: you.

229.3: You
229.4: do
229.6: not
229.8: know
230.0: me,
230.2: I
230.4: do
230.6: not
230.8: know
231.0: you.

231.1: Let
231.2: me
231.3: introduce
231.6: myself
231.9: to
232.2: you.

232.4: My
232.5: name
232.7: is
232.8: Alden
233.0: Kupferberg.

233.5: Robbie
234.0: Feinberg.
234.2: Chester
234.4: Ming.

235.0: I
235.0: am
235.4: Senior
235.8: Vice
236.0: President
236.2: at
236.4: Stratton
236.6: Oakmont...

237.1: and
237.3: I
237.5: plan
237.9: on
237.9: being
238.1: one
238.3: of
238.5: the...

238.4: top
239.0: brokers
239.8: in
240.0: my
240.1: firm
240.5: next
240.7: year.

240.9: And
241.1: I
241.3: am
241.5: not
241.7: gonna
241.9: get
242.1: there
242.3: by
242.5: being
242.7: wrong,
242.9: Stanley.

243.0: I
243.2: do
243.4: wanna
243.6: say
243.8: that
244.0: you
244.2: sound
244.4: like
244.6: a...

245.0: You
245.2: sound
245.4: like
245.6: a
245.8: pretty
246.0: sincere
246.2: guy.

246.9: It
247.1: is
247.3: not
247.5: gonna
247.7: make
247.9: you
248.1: rich

248.0: and
248.1: it
248.3: is
248.5: not
248.7: gonna
248.9: make
249.1: you
249.3: poor.

249.2: But
249.4: what
249.6: this
249.8: trade
250.0: will
250.2: do
250.4: is
250.6: serve
250.8: as...

251.7: a
251.9: benchmark
252.1: for
252.3: future
252.5: business,
252.7: Kevin.

254.1: You
254.2: feel
254.4: comfortable
254.6: with
255.0: me
255.1: now,
255.3: Scotty?

256.0: And
256.2: then
256.4: you
256.6: will
256.8: know
257.0: for
257.2: sure

257.3: that
257.5: you
257.7: finally
257.9: found
258.1: a
258.3: broker
258.5: on
258.7: Wall
258.9: Street

259.8: that
259.8: you
260.0: can
260.2: trust,

261.1: and
261.3: who
261.8: can
262.0: consistently
262.4: make
263.6: you
264.1: money.

265.1: Sound
265.6: fair
265.8: enough?

268.3: You
268.3: know
268.3: what...
268.3: Yeah.

271.1: I
271.2: gotta
271.4: say,
271.6: I
271.8: am
272.0: pretty
272.2: impressed.

274.7: What
274.9: are
275.1: you
275.3: thinking?

275.9: Kevin.

278.0: You
278.4: give
