6.0: I
6.1: do
6.1: not
6.4: think
6.6: I
6.8: felt
7.0: a
7.2: thing
7.3: the
7.6: first
7.9: time
8.1: I
8.3: did
8.6: this.

9.3: I
9.3: was
9.3: so
9.3: nervous.

12.8: This
13.4: is
13.5: as
13.6: beautiful
13.8: as
14.0: you
14.2: were
14.5: back
14.8: then.
15.0: You
15.3: think
15.9: so?

17.5: Just
18.0: a
18.1: little
18.2: older.

19.5: And
19.9: a
20.4: little
20.8: fuller...
21.3: But
21.8: you
22.0: look
22.2: good.

27.3: Here
27.7: we
27.8: go.
28.0: Again.

39.4: That'a
39.6: girl

44.0: ..
44.2: And
44.4: Colonel
44.6: John
44.8: Glenn
45.0: will
45.2: be
45.4: the
45.6: first
45.8: American
46.0: to
46.2: orbit
46.4: the
46.6: Earth.

48.0: As
48.3: you
48.4: can
48.5: see,
48.6: there
48.9: are
49.0: thousands
49.7: of
49.8: people
49.8: here
50.4: to
50.6: witness
50.7: this
50.9: historic
51.1: event

53.3: Paul,
53.9: something's
54.5: off
54.7: here.
54.9: These
55.1: landing
55.5: coordinates
55.8: do
55.8: not
56.2: match
56.4: yesterday's.

58.8: The
59.0: IBM
59.2: just
59.4: ran
59.6: them.

61.8: So
61.9: then
62.1: the
62.2: IBM
62.7: was
62.7: wrong
63.0: yesterday,
63.1: right?

66.4: Or
66.4: the
66.4: damn
66.6: thing
66.9: is
67.2: wrong
67.4: today.

71.7: Paul,
72.3: Am
73.5: I
73.6: right?
74.0: It
74.6: appears
75.3: so.

78.7: The
78.9: IBM
79.1: has
79.3: been
79.5: spot
79.7: on
79.9: up
80.1: to
80.3: this
80.5: point,
80.7: John.

81.0: But
81.2: we
81.4: will
81.6: run
81.8: it
82.0: again,
82.2: to
82.4: see
82.6: what
82.8: it
83.0: comes
83.2: up
83.4: with.

83.5: I
83.7: will
83.9: be
84.0: honest
84.3: with
84.4: you,
84.5: Al
84.6: When
84.9: I
85.3: fly,
85.7: I
86.1: fly
86.5: the
86.7: machine,

87.3: Right
87.8: now,
88.0: it
88.1: seems
88.2: like
88.4: this
88.6: machine
88.9: is
89.2: flying
89.5: me.

89.9: We
90.0: are
90.2: on
90.4: the
90.5: same
90.5: page,
90.9: John.
91.3: Our
91.5: guys
91.6: are
91.8: on
92.0: it.

92.5: Let's
92.9: get
93.0: the
93.1: girl
93.4: to
93.5: check
93.6: the
93.8: numbers.

95.1: The
95.4: girl?
95.6: Yes,
95.8: sir.

98.9: You
99.1: mean
99.4: Katherine?
99.7: Yes,
100.2: sir.
100.2: The
100.3: smart
101.0: one.

102.2: If
102.4: she
102.6: says
102.9: they
102.9: are
103.0: good,
103.3: I
103.3: am
103.6: ready
103.8: to
103.9: go.

105.7: All
106.1: right.
106.3: We
106.3: will
106.5: get
106.6: into
106.9: it.
107.1: Roger!

110.2: Sam!
112.2: Go
112.6: find
112.9: Katherine
113.3: Goble.

113.6: She
114.2: needs
114.4: to
114.4: verify
114.6: Glenn's
114.8: Go/No
115.0: Go
115.7: or
115.9: we
116.2: are
116.4: staying
116.7: on
116.9: the
117.0: ground.

117.5: Yes,
117.7: sir.

142.6: I
142.8: am
143.0: looking
143.2: for
143.4: Katherine
143.6: Goble

144.1: It
144.1: is
144.2: Katherine
144.9: Johnson
145.0: now.
145.0: They
145.1: need
145.2: you
145.3: to
145.4: verify
145.5: these
146.6: coordinates.

157.2: All
157.6: right.
157.9: Give
158.0: her
158.1: some
158.3: space
158.7: to
158.8: work.

162.7: A
162.9: truly
163.1: historic
163.3: day
163.5: for
163.7: America..

165.6: The
166.0: country
166.4: has
166.6: waited
167.0: for
167.4: several
167.6: months,
168.0: through
168.8: many
169.3: failed
169.8: unmanned
170.4: Atlas
171.0: rocket
171.4: tests

171.8: and
172.0: 10
172.2: scheduled
172.4: manned
172.6: attempts,

174.7: which
175.1: were
175.3: canceled
175.8: for
176.0: various
176.3: mechanical
176.5: or
176.7: system
176.9: complications.

179.6: All
179.8: the
180.1: final
180.2: tests
180.5: and
180.7: checks
181.6: are
181.7: being
181.9: conducted,
182.3: John
183.3: Glenn
183.6: is
183.8: ready
184.3: to
184.4: board
184.6: the
184.8: Friendship
185.3: 7.

186.1: But
186.3: today
186.5: we
186.7: remain
186.9: truly
187.1: optimistic

188.4: and
188.6: it
188.8: is
189.0: a
189.2: go
189.4: day
189.6: in
189.8: all
190.0: regards

191.0: the
191.2: capsule
191.4: is
191.6: ready,
191.8: the
192.0: rocket
192.2: itself
192.4: is
192.6: a
192.8: OK,
193.0: and
193.2: the
193.4: weather
193.6: here
193.8: at..

196.3: Anything
196.5: from
196.7: Langley?
196.9: Not
197.1: yet.

198.8: We
199.0: are
199.1: being
199.3: told
199.6: the
200.0: mission
200.6: control
201.0: at
201.1: Nasa
201.5: is
201.8: conducting
202.4: a
202.5: final
203.2: check

203.5: of
203.7: the
203.9: launch
204.1: and
204.3: recovery
204.5: coordinates
204.7: including
204.9: the
205.1: go/no-go
205.3: calculations

208.2: so
208.4: crucial
208.6: to
208.8: a
209.0: safe
209.2: and
209.4: successful
209.6: launch
209.8: and
210.0: recovery

211.0: After
211.6: years
211.8: of
212.0: waiting,
212.3: and
212.6: months
212.8: of
213.0: delays,

213.8: col.
214.0: Glen
214.2: is
214.4: finally
214.6: ready
214.8: for
215.0: that
215.2: space
215.4: flight
215.6: we
215.8: have
216.0: been
216.2: waiting
216.4: for
216.6: with
216.8: so
217.0: much
217.2: anticipation

230.8: We
231.0: are
231.2: still
231.4: a
231.6: go.
231.8: Yes,
232.0: sir.

237.7: That
237.9: is
238.1: it.

242.7: What
243.1: the
243.2: devil
243.3: are
243.5: you
243.7: doing?
243.8: Are
243.9: you
244.0: taking
244.2: a
244.3: break?

292.4: You
292.5: have
292.7: the
292.9: time?

325.6: Sir.

331.0: Pad
331.5: 14.

344.3: Katherine!

350.5: Come
350.7: on

355.3: Sir,
355.5: we
355.7: have
355.9: got
356.1: Pad
356.3: 14
356.5: on

356.9: box.

357.4: Alright,
358.0: let
358.1: me
358.2: in
358.4: there.

361.9: This
362.3: is
362.5: Langley.
362.9: We
363.3: have
363.4: the
363.6: coordinates
363.8: confirmed.

364.8: Standby,
365.0: Langley.

368.7: We
369.1: can
369.4: confirm
369.7: the
369.9: Go/No
370.1: Go
370.6: point
371.2: for
371.4: re-entry
371.9: is..

372.6: 16.11984
375.1: degrees
377.6: latitude
379.4: 165.2356
381.2: degrees
383.1: longitude.

385.0: The
385.2: launch
385.8: window
386.0: is
386.4: a
386.8: go.
387.2: The
387.7: landing
388.1: coordinates
388.3: match.

389.3: That
389.8: is
389.9: very
390.0: good
390.2: news,
390.4: Al.

391.9: It
392.1: is
392.3: a
392.5: little
392.7: hard
392.9: to
393.1: trust
393.3: something
393.5: you
393.7: can
393.9: not
394.1: look
394.3: in
394.5: the
394.7: eyes.

394.5: That
394.7: is
394.9: right,
395.1: Colonel.
395.3: Katherine
395.5: did
395.7: manage
395.9: to
396.1: calculate

397.7: a
397.7: few
397.9: decimal
398.3: points
398.7: further
398.9: than
399.1: that
399.2: hunk
399.5: of
399.6: metal.

400.8: Well,
401.2: I
401.3: will

423.9: feet

432.6: The

461.2: It
461.4: is
461.6: getting
461.8: bumpy
462.0: along
462.2: here.

463.1: Roger
463.3: that.
463.5: You

471.2: "OK".
471.3: Go

481.7: Zero
482.3: G.
482.5: And
482.7: I

484.5: John
485.0: Glenn

485.6: everything
485.9: looks
486.3: good

487.9: Oh,
488.1: that
488.3: view
488.5: is
488.7: tremendous.

491.9: Roger

499.4: You
499.6: are
499.8: go

507.7: All
507.9: right.
508.2: 10.5
508.5: hours
509.0: to
509.1: go.
509.1: If
509.2: we
510.0: make
510.3: 7
510.6: round
510.9: trips.

512.8: I
513.0: could
513.3: use
513.5: a
513.5: coffee.

515.8: Well,
516.3: as
516.8: we
517.0: approach
517.2: the
517.5: end
517.8: of
517.9: day
518.0: here
518.4: on
518.4: the
518.5: Eastern
518.9: seaboard..

519.5: Colonel
520.0: Glenn
520.0: is
520.5: just
521.0: beginning
521.2: his
521.4: third
521.9: orbit.

522.4: Three
522.8: quarters
523.1: of
523.2: the
523.3: way
523.4: across
523.8: the
524.2: African
524.5: continent.

525.4: We
525.6: see
525.8: he
526.0: is
526.2: currently
526.4: over
526.6: Zanzibar,
526.8: which
527.0: is
527.2: the
527.4: next
527.6: tracking
527.8: station

529.7: Thankfully
530.4: the

545.8: Always
546.4: changing
546.7: round
547.0: here.
547.0: It
547.1: is
548.5: hard
548.6: to
548.7: keep
548.9: up.

552.6: Seems
553.1: like
553.3: they
553.3: are
553.4: gonna
553.6: need
553.7: a
553.8: permanent
554.1: team
554.4: to
554.5: feed
554.6: that
554.9: IBM

556.3: How
