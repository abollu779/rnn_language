1.7: Petition
2.4: to
2.4: attend
2.8: courses
3.4: at
3.6: Hampton
3.8: High
4.0: School.

8.3: Good
8.7: morning,
8.9: your
9.1: honor.

14.3: Hampton
14.9: High
15.0: School
15.1: is
15.7: a
15.8: white
16.0: school,
16.2: Mrs.
16.4: Jackson.

18.1: Yes,
18.6: your
18.8: Honor.
19.0: I
19.0: am
19.2: aware
19.4: of
19.6: that.

19.5: Virginia
19.9: is
20.4: still
20.8: a
21.3: segregated
21.9: state.

22.2: Regardless
23.1: of
23.2: what
23.4: the
23.5: Federal
23.8: Government
24.0: says,
24.2: or
24.4: regardless
24.6: what..

25.6: Supreme
26.1: Court
26.4: says
26.6: our
26.8: law..

27.9: Is
28.1: the
28.3: law.

29.2: Your
29.6: Honor,
30.1: if
30.5: I
30.7: may.

31.8: I
32.1: believe
32.3: there
32.5: are
32.6: special
33.0: circumstances
33.7: to
33.8: be
34.0: considered.

34.1: What
34.9: would
35.1: warrant
35.4: a
35.8: colored
36.1: woman
36.3: attendin'
36.5: a
36.7: white
36.9: school?

39.2: May
39.7: I
39.8: approach
40.0: the
40.2: bench,
40.4: sir?

54.2: Your
54.4: Honor,

55.6: You
55.8: of
56.1: all
56.3: people
56.5: should
56.8: understand
57.5: the
57.6: importance
57.8: of
58.0: being
58.2: first.

59.8: How's
60.3: that,
60.6: Mrs.
60.9: Jackson?

61.9: Well,
62.6: you
62.6: were
62.7: the
62.9: first
63.0: in
63.2: your
63.4: family

63.9: to
64.0: serve
64.8: in
64.9: the
65.0: Armed
65.3: Forces.

66.3: US
66.9: Navy.

67.7: The
68.1: first
68.5: to
68.6: attend
68.8: University.

70.2: George
70.9: Mason.

71.6: And
72.2: the
72.3: first
72.7: State
73.0: Judge
73.4: to
73.5: be
73.8: re-commissioned
74.2: by
74.6: three
74.9: consecutive
75.1: Governors.

76.7: You
76.7: have
77.1: done
77.3: some
77.6: research.

78.7: Yes,
78.9: sir.

80.3: What
80.5: is
81.0: the
81.2: point?

81.4: The
82.3: point
82.6: is,
82.8: your
83.0: Honor...

83.5: No
83.7: Negro
83.9: woman
84.1: in
84.3: the
84.5: State
84.7: of
84.9: Virginia
85.1: has
85.3: ever
85.5: attended
85.7: an
85.9: all
86.1: white
86.3: high
86.5: school.

88.1: It
88.6: is
88.8: unheard
89.0: of.
89.2: Yeah!
89.4: Unheard
89.6: of.

92.1: And
92.5: before
92.8: Alan
93.1: Shepard
93.4: sat
93.8: on
93.9: top
94.1: of
94.2: a
94.4: rocket,

94.4: no
95.2: other
95.5: American
95.8: had
96.2: ever
96.4: touched
96.6: space.

97.1: And
97.8: now,
98.0: he
98.2: will
98.4: forever
98.7: be
99.0: remembered
99.1: as
99.7: the
99.8: US
100.3: Navy
100.7: man
100.9: from
101.1: New
101.3: Hampshire.

101.9: The
102.5: first
103.0: to
103.1: touch
103.3: the
103.5: stars.

105.8: And
106.2: I,
106.3: sir.

107.2: I
107.5: plan
107.8: on
107.9: being
108.1: an
108.3: engineer
108.4: at
108.5: NASA.

109.9: But
110.3: I
110.3: can
110.4: not
110.6: do
110.7: that
110.9: without
111.2: taking
111.5: them
111.6: classes
112.1: at
112.3: that
112.5: all-white
112.8: high
112.9: school.

114.3: And
114.6: I
114.9: can
115.0: not
115.1: change
115.3: the
115.6: color
115.9: of
115.9: my
116.1: skin.

117.9: So,
118.3: I
118.4: have
118.7: no
118.8: choice..
119.0: But
120.1: to
120.4: be
120.5: the
120.6: first.

122.3: Which
122.7: I
122.8: can
122.8: not
123.1: do
123.2: without
123.5: you,
123.7: sir.

125.2: Your
125.9: Honor,

126.9: of
127.1: all
127.3: the
127.4: cases
127.7: you
127.9: will
128.1: hear
128.3: today,

129.1: which
129.5: one
129.6: will
129.8: matter
129.9: in
130.1: a
130.3: hundred
130.6: years
130.8: from
131.0: now?

132.5: Which
133.0: one
133.2: will
133.5: make
133.6: you
133.9: the
134.1: "first?"

146.4: Only
147.0: the
147.2: night
147.4: classes.

149.1: Mrs.
149.7: Jackson.

189.1: How
189.4: late
189.6: did
189.8: you
189.9: say
190.0: it
190.1: was
190.2: gonna
190.4: be?
190.6: No
190.9: more
191.1: than
191.4: 5
191.7: minutes
191.9: sir.

192.4: Gus
192.6: Grissom's
192.8: coordinates..

193.6: I
193.6: would
194.4: like
194.6: to
194.7: get
194.8: a
194.9: jump
195.1: on
195.3: John
195.6: Glenn's
195.9: trajectory.

198.2: Do
198.5: you
198.9: have
199.0: any
199.2: idea
199.3: what
199.4: you
199.5: are
199.6: asking?

200.0: An
200.0: orbital
200.8: launch
200.9: with
201.1: an
201.2: Atlas
201.4: Rocket
202.0: is
202.2: going
202.5: to
202.6: take
202.8: time.

203.5: Is
203.8: there
203.9: a
204.0: problem?

206.5: Mr.
207.2: Harrison...

208.7: I
209.1: was
209.3: wondering....

210.4: I
210.4: have
211.1: been
211.4: wondering
211.7: my
211.9: whole
212.1: life.
212.3: So
212.5: just...
212.8: Spit
213.6: it
213.7: out.

214.1: Well,
214.3: sir.

218.4: I
218.7: would
218.9: like
219.0: to
219.1: get
219.3: a
219.3: jump
219.6: on
219.7: John
220.0: Glenn's
220.3: trajectory.

220.9: This
221.1: is
221.4: not
221.6: about
221.9: plugging
222.2: in
222.4: numbers,
222.5: this
222.7: is
222.9: about
223.1: inventing
223.3: the
223.5: math.

224.4: I
224.5: think
224.7: we
224.9: talked
225.2: about
225.3: that,
225.5: right?
225.7: It
225.9: does
226.1: not
226.3: exist.

226.3: I
227.0: can
227.2: do
227.3: it,
227.5: sir.

227.7: Do
227.9: you
228.1: know
228.3: any
228.5: idea
228.7: how
228.9: exacting
229.1: these
229.3: calculations
229.5: have
229.7: to
229.9: be?

231.4: It
231.6: is
232.0: like
232.1: shooting
232.3: a
232.5: sawed-off
232.9: shotgun
233.1: from
233.4: a
233.7: thousand
233.9: feet,

234.0: and
234.4: getting
234.8: that
234.9: one
235.1: beebee
235.3: through
235.6: a
235.7: hole
235.9: so
236.1: tiny,
236.3: you
236.5: can
236.7: not
236.9: even
237.1: see
237.3: it.

236.8: I
236.8: am
237.5: an
237.6: excellent
237.8: shot,
238.0: sir.

239.4: How
239.8: about
240.1: Grissom's
240.4: numbers.
240.6: Paul?

242.0: They
242.0: have
242.5: been
242.7: spot
242.9: on.

246.0: Give
246.2: Glenn's
246.9: orbit
247.1: a
247.3: go.

248.9: But
249.3: you
249.4: run
249.6: it
249.7: all
249.8: through
249.9: Stafford.
250.1: Understood?

250.7: Yes,
250.9: sir.

252.3: Thank
252.9: you.

257.6: Computers
258.4: do
258.4: not
258.6: author
258.8: reports.

266.2: Capcom,
266.4: this
266.6: is
266.8: Liberty
267.0: Bell
267.2: 7

269.2: loud
269.5: and
269.6: clear

272.0: ok,
272.2: it
272.4: is
272.6: nice
272.8: ride
273.0: up
273.2: to
273.4: now

283.5: Liberty
284.1: Bell
284.3: 7
284.8: capsule
284.9: is
285.6: taking
285.9: on
286.1: water.

286.8: Gus
287.2: Grissom
287.4: is
287.9: out
288.2: of
288.3: the
288.5: capsule.
288.8: Rescuers
289.2: are
289.8: now
289.9: going
290.1: to
290.4: pull
291.1: him
291.3: from
291.5: the
291.8: Ocean
292.0: waves.

292.7: Unfortunately,
293.8: Liberty
294.1: Bell
294.3: 7
294.7: capsule..

295.7: ..
295.8: Is
296.2: lost.

308.1: Mr.
308.6: Harrison,
309.0: Taxpayer
309.5: money
309.7: sank
309.9: in
310.2: the
310.4: ocean
310.7: along
310.9: with
311.0: your
311.2: capsule.

311.7: What
312.1: makes
312.3: you
312.6: think
312.7: you
312.9: can
313.0: bring
313.1: John
313.5: Glenn
313.7: home
313.9: safely?

315.0: Let
315.4: me
315.5: say
315.7: first
315.9: that
316.2: discovery
316.5: is
316.7: never
317.2: for
317.3: the
317.5: sake
317.7: of
317.9: discovery,
318.1: Gentlemen,

318.8: but
318.9: for
319.1: the
319.2: sake
319.4: of
319.5: human
319.7: survival.

321.4: It
321.8: will
321.9: always
322.1: come
322.3: with
322.5: the
322.7: risk.

325.2: Whoever
325.8: gets
325.9: there
326.0: first,
326.2: will
326.7: make
326.9: the
327.0: rules.
327.1: That
327.3: has
327.5: been
327.8: true
328.0: of
328.1: every
328.4: civilization.
328.7: And
328.9: so..

330.2: I
330.6: think
331.0: the
331.1: bigger
331.4: question
331.4: for
332.0: this
332.1: body
332.5: to
332.7: consider
332.9: is..

333.3: Who
333.6: do
334.6: you
334.7: want
335.0: calling
335.3: the
335.4: shots
335.6: in
335.9: space?

337.7: We
338.1: have
338.2: to
338.4: know
338.5: what
338.6: is
338.8: out
338.9: there,
339.1: Senator.

340.5: We
340.8: have
340.9: to
341.1: touch
341.3: the
341.4: stars.
341.7: If
342.0: only
342.4: to
342.9: ensure
343.1: our
343.6: own
343.8: survival.

343.9: And
344.5: only
344.9: a
345.0: man
345.2: can
345.4: do
345.6: that.

348.0: We
348.2: will
348.6: get
348.7: John
349.0: Glenn
349.3: home
349.4: safely
349.8: because
350.0: we
350.2: have
350.4: to,

352.1: because
352.3: he
352.6: has
352.8: to
352.9: tell
353.1: us
353.2: what
353.3: he
353.5: saw.

357.9: The
358.2: Redstone
358.6: Rocket
359.1: went
359.3: straight
359.5: up.

360.0: But
360.2: the
360.4: capsule..

361.2: ..
361.5: Did
361.5: not
361.9: have
361.9: enough
362.1: speed
362.4: to
362.5: go
362.6: into
362.8: orbit.
363.1: So
363.6: came
363.6: back
363.8: down.

364.7: Essentially
364.9: it
365.1: is
365.3: a
365.4: triangle..
365.6: Earth,
365.8: sub-orbit,
366.0: Earth.

368.2: That
368.7: math
368.9: was
369.0: known.

369.5: That
369.7: took
369.9: Shepard,
370.1: took
370.3: Grissom.

373.4: That
373.8: cannot
374.1: take
374.4: Glenn.

375.6: Now,
375.8: The
376.4: Atlas
376.9: Rocket..

378.3: That
378.8: can
378.9: push
379.1: us
379.2: into
379.3: orbit.
379.4: It
379.6: goes
380.8: up

380.9: delivers
381.2: the
381.7: capsule
382.2: into
382.4: an
382.5: elliptical
382.9: orbit.

384.2: Earth's
384.7: gravity
384.9: keeps
385.1: pulling
385.3: it,

386.0: but
386.1: it
386.2: is
386.4: going
386.5: so
386.8: fast
386.8: that
386.9: it
387.0: keeps
387.5: missing
387.7: the
387.9: Earth.

388.4: That
388.6: is
388.9: how
389.1: it
389.4: stays
389.6: in
389.8: orbit.

390.7: Now,
391.1: Getting
391.9: it
392.1: back
392.3: down...

393.7: That
394.0: is
394.5: the
394.6: math
394.8: we
395.0: do
395.0: not
395.2: know.

397.7: Yes,
397.9: Katherine

398.8: So,
399.1: the
399.4: capsule
400.2: will
400.4: spin
400.8: around
401.0: the
401.2: Earth
401.4: forever,

401.8: because
401.9: there
402.0: is
402.3: nothing
402.6: to
402.7: slow
402.9: it
403.1: down?

403.9: That
404.7: is
405.1: right.
405.6: Slowing
406.0: it
406.1: down
406.2: at
407.0: precisely
407.6: the
407.7: right
407.8: moment,

408.4: by
408.6: precisely
408.8: the
409.0: right
409.2: amount

410.1: That
410.4: is
411.0: the
411.2: task.

414.5: Yes,
414.7: Katherine

415.4: So,
415.9: it
416.4: means
416.9: to
417.4: move
417.9: from
418.4: an
418.9: elliptical
419.4: orbit..
419.9: To
420.4: a
421.0: parabolic
421.2: orbit?

422.8: Yes.
425.2: That
425.4: is
425.6: the
425.8: Go/
426.0: No
426.2: Go.

426.6: Now,
426.8: this
427.5: point
427.9: is
428.1: a
428.1: pin
428.3: head.

429.4: We
429.8: bring
430.0: him
430.1: in
430.3: too
430.4: soon..
430.7: He
431.4: burns
431.7: up
431.8: on
432.0: reentry.

433.1: That
433.2: is
433.4: right.
433.5: We
434.7: bring
434.9: him
435.1: too
435.3: late,
435.5: and
435.7: he
435.9: is
436.2: pushed
436.6: out
436.7: of
436.7: Earth's
437.0: gravity.

437.2: Any
438.1: changes
438.5: to
438.7: mass,
439.2: weight,
439.6: speed,
440.1: time,

440.9: distance,
441.4: friction...
442.0: or
442.6: a
443.1: puff
443.7: of
444.3: wind..
444.8: Would
445.4: alter
446.0: the
446.0: Go/No
446.1: Go.

447.5: And
447.9: we
448.1: start
448.3: our
448.6: calculations..
448.8: Over

451.2: Yes.

452.6: So,
453.1: we
453.5: need
453.9: to
454.4: be
454.6: able
454.9: to
455.2: choose
455.6: this
456.3: re-entry
456.5: point.

457.5: This
457.9: Go/No
458.3: Go.
458.9: This
459.5: has
459.7: to
459.8: be
459.9: exact.

461.1: Sam

462.4: These
462.9: are
463.0: the
463.1: latest
463.5: Redstone
463.7: numbers
464.2: and
464.8: current
465.2: capsule
465.4: data.

465.7: Obviously,
466.9: we
467.0: know
467.1: the
467.3: launch
467.5: spot

468.3: The
468.5: Pentagon
468.7: Briefing
468.9: should
469.1: illuminate
469.3: where
469.5: the
469.7: Navy
469.9: needs
470.1: the
470.3: recovery
470.5: zone.

472.4: When
473.1: we
473.2: work
473.4: backwards
473.5: from
474.1: there.

475.2: And
475.6: the
475.9: rest
476.4: is
476.4: on
476.7: us.
476.9: So,
477.2: let's
477.4: get
477.6: to
477.8: work.

478.9: Mr.
479.9: Stafford.
480.1: What,
480.3: Katherine?

481.2: If
481.6: I
482.1: could
482.3: attend
482.5: the
482.8: briefings,
483.0: I
483.3: would
483.5: be
483.6: more
483.9: useful
484.2: to
484.3: the
484.5: project.

485.3: Pentagon
485.6: briefing
486.0: is
486.3: a
486.7: closed
487.0: door.

487.3: Yes.
487.5: But
487.7: if
487.9: we
488.1: do
488.3: not
488.5: have
488.7: the
488.9: information,

490.8: of
491.2: the
491.6: changes..
492.0: We
492.1: can
492.1: not
492.8: keep
493.0: up.
493.2: I
493.4: need
493.6: those
493.8: changes
494.1: as
494.3: they
494.5: occur.

494.4: As
494.6: you
494.8: said,
495.0: it
495.2: is
495.4: a
495.6: pin
495.8: head.
496.0: Katherine,
496.2: that
496.4: is
496.6: the
496.8: job.

497.1: You
497.7: asked
498.4: for
498.4: this
498.6: assignment.
498.9: So
499.5: just
499.7: calculate
499.9: with
500.1: what
500.3: you
500.5: have.

501.4: Or
501.6: we
501.9: will
502.2: find
502.5: someone
502.7: who
502.9: can.

510.1: OK.

523.9: That'a
524.1: girl.

526.1: And
526.9: what
527.0: the
527.1: hell
527.3: are
527.3: you
527.4: doing?
527.7: You
528.1: can
528.1: not
528.3: be
528.5: in
528.7: here

528.5: Who
529.4: are
529.5: you?

530.1: I
530.1: am
530.5: with
530.6: the
530.7: West
531.1: Computing
531.7: Group.

532.3: Dorothy
533.3: Vaughan,
533.5: sir.

533.9: Well,
534.1: this
534.3: is
534.5: a
534.7: very
534.9: delicate
535.1: piece
535.3: of
535.5: equipment.

536.1: I
536.4: am
536.7: sorry,
537.0: sir.
537.0: I
537.1: am
537.2: just
537.2: trying
537.5: to
537.6: be
537.7: helpful.

538.9: Bill,
539.4: we
539.7: have
540.1: got
540.3: numbers.

542.7: What
542.9: kind
543.1: of
543.3: numbers?

548.6: Well,
548.8: I
549.0: will
549.2: be.

550.9: What
551.0: is
551.5: your
551.5: name
551.6: again?

553.1: Dorothy
553.8: Vaughan.

555.0: Dorothy
556.1: Vaughan...

564.4: Sir,
564.8: the
565.3: parameters
565.5: for
565.7: Friendship
565.9: 7.

566.3: Oh,
567.7: this
567.8: is
567.9: all
568.3: moot.
568.7: We
568.7: are
568.9: altering
569.0: the
569.3: window
569.5: on
569.6: the
569.7: capsule.

570.5: When
570.7: did
570.9: this
571.1: happen?

571.6: 6
571.9: minutes
572.1: ago.
572.2: The
572.4: mass
572.6: is
572.7: changing.
573.0: Start
573.3: over.

573.7: Sir..
574.1: If
574.5: I
575.0: could
575.5: attend
576.0: briefings..
576.2: I
576.4: could
576.6: stay
576.8: current..

577.2: Katherine,
577.4: we
577.6: have
577.8: been
578.0: through
578.2: this.
578.4: It
578.6: is
578.8: not
579.0: possible.

579.5: There
579.7: is
579.9: no
580.1: protocol
580.3: for
580.5: women
580.7: attending.

581.5: There
581.7: is
581.9: no
582.1: protocol
582.3: for
582.5: a
582.7: man
582.9: circling
583.1: the
583.3: Earth
583.5: either,
583.7: sir.

583.8: OK.
584.0: That
584.2: is
584.4: just
584.6: the
584.8: way
585.0: things
585.2: are.
