7.1: This
7.2: one,
7.3: like
7.4: make
7.5: a
7.6: two.
7.8: Make
7.9: a
8.0: double.
8.1: OK?
8.2: Get
8.4: it?

13.9: No
14.3: one
14.5: thought
14.5: to
14.8: measure
15.1: these
15.2: things.

16.3: I
16.3: am
16.7: afraid,
16.9: not.
17.1: Sir.

19.4: Would
19.9: you
19.9: like
20.1: us
20.2: to
20.3: stop?

21.8: No.
22.0: No,
22.2: just..

24.3: I
24.5: see,
24.8: no.
25.1: Just
25.5: keep
25.7: going.

27.7: In
27.8: fact

28.8: Use..
29.1: Use
29.5: the
29.6: big
30.3: hammer
30.5: Yes,
30.7: sir.

31.7: Come
31.8: on,
32.0: use
32.2: the
32.4: big
32.5: hammer.
32.9: You
33.0: heard
33.2: the
33.4: man.
33.6: Let's
33.8: go!

61.0: Ma'am.

64.3: Our
64.5: runner
64.8: can
65.1: pick
65.2: up
65.4: your
65.5: work,
65.8: Dorothy.

67.3: You
67.8: need
68.0: to
68.0: be
68.2: workin',
68.4: not
68.6: walkin'.

69.3: Oh!
69.5: It
69.7: is
69.9: break
70.1: time,
70.3: ma'am.
70.5: No
70.7: trouble
70.9: at
71.1: all.

72.3: Well,
72.6: since
72.8: you
73.1: made
73.4: the
73.5: trip

74.5: you
74.9: can
75.0: take
75.2: that
75.3: batch
75.5: over
76.0: there

77.5: Sure
77.9: thing,
78.1: Mrs.
78.4: Mitchell.

82.2: You
82.5: need
82.8: somethin'
83.1: else?

83.6: Yes,
84.2: ma'am.

85.3: I
85.7: was
85.9: wondering
86.3: if
86.5: you
86.7: knew
86.9: what
87.0: they
87.0: are
87.1: building
87.3: over
87.5: in
87.7: the
87.8: Tech
88.0: Wing.

90.9: It
91.1: is
91.3: called
91.5: an
91.7: IBM.

93.1: A
93.3: mainframe
93.5: machine.

95.2: Apparently,
95.5: it
95.9: can
96.1: do
96.1: our
96.3: calculations
97.1: in
97.1: a
97.2: fraction
97.6: of
97.6: the
97.7: time.

100.1: Guess
100.3: that
100.6: is
100.7: good
101.0: for
101.2: NASA.

105.3: Hurry
105.8: on,
105.9: now.
106.0: Best
106.4: if
106.5: you
106.6: do
106.7: it
106.8: in
106.8: one
106.9: trip.

125.4: Excuse
125.6: me

171.0: Is
171.4: that
171.5: correct?

173.7: Yeah

181.7: Whose
182.1: work
182.3: is
182.4: that?

185.0: I
185.3: said,
185.6: whose
185.8: work
186.1: is
186.2: that?!

189.7: Katherine
190.4: Goble,
190.6: sir.

196.3: How
196.5: did
196.7: you
196.9: know
197.1: the
197.1: Redstone
197.6: could
197.6: not
197.8: support
198.1: orbital
198.5: flight?

199.0: That
199.2: is
199.4: classified
199.6: information

200.3: It
200.5: is
200.7: top
200.9: secret.

202.1: Well,
202.2: it
202.4: is
202.5: no
202.6: secret
202.9: why
203.2: the
203.3: Redstone
203.7: test
203.9: keep
204.1: failing

204.4: its
204.7: flight
205.0: for
205.3: sub-orbital
205.6: flight,
205.9: but
206.2: it
206.2: can
206.2: not
206.4: handle
206.5: the
206.7: weight
206.9: of
207.0: the
207.1: capsule

207.3: and
208.1: push
208.3: it
208.4: into
208.5: space.

209.8: Numbers
210.5: do
210.5: not
210.6: lie.

212.3: And
212.5: you
212.7: figured
212.9: it
213.1: all
213.3: out
213.5: with
213.7: this?

215.9: Half
216.3: the
216.4: data
216.6: is
216.8: redacted

218.8: What
219.1: is
219.3: there
219.5: tells
219.7: the
220.0: story
220.1: if
220.5: you
220.6: read
220.8: between
221.0: the
221.2: lines.

222.2: The
222.6: distance
222.9: from
223.1: launch
223.4: to
223.5: orbit,
223.7: we
223.9: know.
224.1: Then
224.3: mass
224.5: we
224.7: know.

225.2: The
225.4: Mercury
225.6: Capsule
225.8: weight,
226.0: we
226.2: know.

227.3: And
227.4: the
227.5: speeds
228.3: are
228.4: there..
228.6: In
229.1: the
229.6: data.

230.7: You
230.9: did
231.1: the
231.2: math.

232.5: Yes,
233.0: sir.

234.4: I
234.6: looked
234.8: beyond.

238.3: And
238.4: how
238.8: do
238.9: you
239.0: know
239.1: about
239.2: the
239.4: Atlas
239.7: rocket?

243.5: That
243.9: is
244.2: not
244.4: math.

245.8: That
246.1: data's
246.4: not
246.5: here.
246.8: Like
247.0: he
247.2: said,
247.2: it
247.3: is
247.6: classified.

254.8: I
254.8: held
255.4: it
255.5: up
255.6: to
255.7: the
255.9: light.

257.2: You
257.4: held
257.6: it
257.8: up
258.0: to
258.2: the
258.4: light?
258.6: Yes,
258.8: sir.

264.9: Yep.
265.1: There
265.3: it
265.5: is.

268.3: Atlas

270.2: What
270.2: is
270.4: your
270.7: name?

271.5: Katherine
272.2: Goble.

274.3: Are
274.5: you
274.7: a
274.9: spy,
275.1: Katherine?
275.3: Am
275.5: I
275.7: what?

276.5: I
276.7: am
276.9: saying,
277.1: are
277.3: you
277.5: a
277.7: Russian
277.9: spy?
278.1: No,
278.3: sir.

279.5: I
279.5: am
279.9: not
280.1: Russian.

282.5: She
282.7: is
282.9: not
283.1: Russian,
283.3: sir.

285.9: All
286.3: right
286.4: then,
286.6: we
286.7: have
286.9: nothing
287.1: to
287.2: lose
287.4: here.

287.8: Give
288.2: her
288.2: everything
288.5: she
288.7: needs
288.9: to
289.1: work
289.2: on
289.4: Shepard's
289.6: trajectories.

290.2: Without
290.7: redaction.
291.3: Are
291.4: we
291.5: clear
291.7: now?

292.1: Right.
292.3: Are
292.5: we
292.7: sure
292.9: about
293.1: this?

294.1: What
294.3: is
294.5: the
294.7: issue,
294.9: Paul?
295.1: You
295.3: heard
295.5: her.

296.3: She
296.4: is
296.5: not
296.6: a
296.8: spy.

298.6: I..
298.7: I
298.8: just
299.4: do
299.4: not
299.5: think
299.5: it
299.6: is
299.7: a
299.8: good
299.8: idea.

300.5: You
300.7: know
300.9: what
301.1: I
301.3: think
301.5: is
301.7: a
301.9: good
302.1: idea?

302.7: Darker
302.9: ink.

304.3: I
304.5: think
304.7: darker
304.9: ink
305.1: is
305.3: a
305.5: good
305.7: idea.
305.9: Ruth,
306.1: could
306.3: pass
306.5: it
306.7: along?

306.8: Yes,
307.2: sir.

308.1: Thank
308.3: you,
308.5: Katherine
308.7: Thank
308.9: you,
309.1: sir.

316.7: This
317.1: interrogation
317.4: is
318.0: over

337.3: You
337.7: can
337.8: probably
338.0: get
338.2: to
338.3: the
338.4: moon
338.8: and
338.8: back
339.0: with
339.3: this.

339.4: Just
340.0: not
340.2: the
340.4: bathroom.

341.3: At
341.4: least
341.6: they
341.7: are
341.9: not
342.1: blind
342.3: to
342.5: what
342.7: you
342.9: do.

342.9: It
343.0: is
343.3: not
343.5: going
343.6: to
343.6: matter
343.9: soon.

344.7: This
345.2: IBM's
345.2: going
345.7: to
345.8: put
345.9: us
346.0: all
346.3: out
346.4: of
346.5: work.

348.0: What
348.6: can
348.8: we
348.9: do
348.9: about
349.1: it?

350.4: Only
350.6: one
350.8: thing
351.0: to
351.2: do

352.3: Learn
352.9: all
353.0: we
353.1: can.
353.5: Make
353.7: ourselves
353.9: valuable.

354.8: Somewhere
355.4: down
355.6: the
355.8: line
356.0: a
356.2: human
356.4: being's
356.6: going
356.7: to
356.8: have
356.9: to
357.0: push
357.2: the
357.4: buttons.

357.5: That
357.6: is
357.9: right.

360.8: Oh,
361.1: mercy

362.9: Well,
363.1: she
363.3: must
363.5: be
363.7: lost.

363.9: NASA
364.7: does
364.7: not
364.9: commission
365.4: females
365.9: for
366.0: the
366.1: Engineer
366.5: Training
366.7: Program.

368.2: That
368.7: position
368.9: is
369.4: available
369.7: to
370.3: any
370.6: qualified
371.5: applicant.

372.2: Right.
372.8: Except
373.1: you
373.2: do
373.2: not
373.3: have
373.6: the
373.7: educational
373.8: requirements.

374.6: I
375.1: have
375.3: a
375.6: Bachelors
375.9: Degree
376.0: in
376.4: Mathematics
376.7: and
377.0: Physical
377.2: Sciences.

377.6: It
377.9: is
378.0: the
378.0: same
378.4: as
378.5: most
378.7: engineers
378.9: around
379.1: here.

379.7: Well,
380.4: we
380.5: now
380.7: require
381.0: advanced
381.7: extension
382.1: courses
382.3: through
382.6: the
382.7: University
383.2: of
383.3: Virginia.

384.0: It
384.2: is
384.4: in
384.6: the
384.8: Employee
385.0: Handbook.
385.2: An
385.4: addendum.

387.3: Case
387.5: you
387.7: have
387.9: not
388.1: read
388.3: it

389.3: Every
389.9: time
390.2: we
390.3: have
390.5: a
390.6: chance
390.9: to
391.0: get
391.2: ahead,
391.4: they
392.0: move
392.2: the
392.3: finish
392.5: line.

392.6: I
393.0: just
393.3: follow
393.5: the
393.6: rules
393.9: around
394.0: here.
394.3: And
394.5: I
394.7: expect..

395.3: Everyone
395.7: who
395.8: works
395.9: for
396.1: me
396.3: to
396.4: follow
396.6: them
396.7: as
396.8: well.

397.6: There
397.8: are
398.0: no
398.2: special
398.6: circumstances
399.3: for
399.5: anyone.

400.7: You
401.0: all
401.4: should
401.6: be
401.7: thankful,
402.0: you
402.3: have
402.4: jobs
402.8: at
403.0: all.

409.0: "For
409.3: those
409.7: that
409.7: cannot
410.0: attend
410.2: classes

411.0: at
411.2: the
411.3: University
411.5: of
412.0: Virginia,

412.7: Advanced
413.6: Extension
414.1: Courses
414.5: are
414.7: available
414.8: at
415.5: Hampton
416.0: High
416.2: School."

417.9: That
418.1: is
418.3: still
418.5: a
418.7: segregated
418.9: school,
419.1: Mary

420.2: Virginia
421.0: acts
421.3: like
421.5: Brown
421.8: vs.
422.2: Board
422.3: of
422.5: Education
422.6: never
422.8: happened.

423.5: They
424.0: will
424.5: never
424.8: gonna
425.1: allow
425.5: a
425.7: colored
426.2: woman

427.0: classes
427.5: at
427.6: an
427.7: all
427.9: white
428.1: school!

428.8: Sounds
429.7: about
430.0: right.
430.0: That
430.1: is
431.1: all
431.4: you
431.5: are
431.6: gonna
431.8: say?

431.9: Well,
