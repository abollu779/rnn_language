34.3: Where
34.7: the
34.7: hell
34.9: have
34.9: you
35.1: been?

36.0: Everywhere
36.3: I
36.7: look
36.8: you
36.9: are
37.2: not
37.3: where
37.4: I
37.6: need
37.7: you
37.9: to
37.9: be.

38.2: And
38.4: it
38.6: is
38.8: not
39.0: my
39.2: imagination.
39.4: So
39.6: where
39.8: the
40.0: hell
40.2: do
40.4: you
40.6: go
40.8: everyday?

44.8: To
45.1: the
45.2: bathroom,
45.4: sir.

46.2: The
46.5: bathroom

48.6: To
48.6: the
49.2: damn
49.5: bathroom!

50.8: For
51.0: 40
51.6: minutes
51.9: a
51.9: day?

55.1: What
55.3: do
55.5: you
55.7: do
55.9: in
56.1: there?

57.5: We
57.8: are
58.1: T-0
58.4: here.
58.7: I
58.9: put
59.0: a
59.1: lot
59.3: of
59.3: faith
59.6: in
59.7: you.

62.3: There
62.5: is
63.0: no
63.1: bathroom
63.4: for
63.8: me
63.8: here.

65.7: What
66.1: do
66.1: you
66.2: mean
66.2: there
66.3: is
66.5: no
66.7: bathroom
67.0: for
67.2: you
67.4: here?

67.4: There
67.9: is
68.2: no
68.5: bathroom!

69.8: There
70.3: are
70.5: no
70.7: colored
71.2: bathrooms
71.4: in
71.6: this
71.8: building,

72.7: or
73.2: any
73.5: building
73.9: outside
74.1: the
74.4: West
74.6: Campus.

75.0: Which
75.3: is
75.4: half
75.7: a
75.8: mile
76.0: away.
76.1: Did
77.2: you
77.2: know
77.4: that?

79.1: I
79.5: have
79.7: to
79.9: walk
80.0: to
80.2: Timbuktu
80.6: just
80.9: to
81.3: relieve
81.5: myself

82.6: And
83.1: I
83.2: can
83.2: not
83.4: use
83.5: one
83.9: of
84.0: the
84.0: handy
84.2: bikes.

85.1: Picture
85.4: that,
85.7: Mr.
86.1: Harrison

87.2: My
87.4: uniform...

89.1: Skirt
89.6: below
89.8: my
90.0: knees,
90.2: my
90.4: heels

91.9: and
92.1: simple
92.3: string
92.5: of
92.7: pearls.
92.9: Well,
93.1: I
93.3: do
93.5: not
93.7: own
93.9: pearls.

94.7: Lord
94.9: knows
95.1: you
95.3: do
95.5: not
95.7: pay
95.9: the
96.1: coloreds
96.3: enough
96.5: to
96.7: afford
96.9: pearls!

98.9: And
99.8: I
99.9: work
100.4: like
100.8: a
101.0: dog
101.2: day
101.4: and
101.6: night,

103.2: living
103.4: off
103.6: a
103.8: coffee
104.0: from
104.2: a
104.4: pot
104.6: none
104.8: of
105.0: you
105.2: want
105.4: to
105.6: touch!

119.9: So,
121.2: excuse
121.4: me..

122.8: If
123.3: I
123.4: have
123.6: to
123.8: go
123.9: to
124.1: the
124.3: restroom
124.5: a
124.8: few
124.9: times
125.2: a
125.5: day

197.6: There
197.8: you
198.0: have
198.2: it!

203.3: No
203.4: more
203.5: colored
203.7: restrooms.

205.4: No
205.6: more
205.8: white
206.0: restrooms.

208.2: Just
208.5: plain
208.8: old
209.1: toilets.

211.0: Go
211.0: wherever
211.7: you
211.8: damn
212.1: well
212.1: please.

213.3: Preferably
213.7: closer
214.1: to
214.2: your
214.3: desk.

222.2: Here
222.3: at
222.5: NASA,

224.2: we
224.5: all
224.7: pee
224.8: the
224.9: same
225.1: color

252.1: Heard
252.4: you
252.7: were
253.0: fighting
253.3: the
253.6: flu.
253.9: Thought
254.2: you
254.5: could
254.8: use
255.1: some
255.3: soup?

256.0: Hot
256.4: meal
256.8: for
256.9: the
256.9: girls.

258.6: Come

277.6: Thank
277.9: you
278.2: for
278.4: this
278.5: meal..

279.6: We
280.0: ask
280.2: that
280.4: you
280.6: blessed
280.8: this
281.3: food,
281.5: so
281.7: that
282.0: it
282.3: may
282.4: bless
282.7: our
282.9: bodies.

283.8: In
284.2: Jesus
284.7: name,
284.9: we
285.1: pray.

287.8: Amen.

293.2: It
293.4: is
293.6: a
293.8: history
294.0: day
294.2: here
294.4: at
294.6: Cape
294.8: Canaveral,
295.0: and
295.2: here
295.4: what
295.6: we
295.8: can
296.0: expect;
296.2: Alan
296.4: Shepard
296.6: and

298.6: Freedom
299.0: 7
299.3: will
299.4: be
299.5: launched
299.8: into
300.1: space
300.3: at
300.6: an
300.9: altitude
301.3: about
301.5: 116
302.4: miles
302.6: an
302.9: hour.

303.1: Dorothy!
303.3: Come
303.5: on
303.7: or
303.9: you
304.1: will
304.3: miss
304.5: it!
304.7: I
304.9: am
305.1: coming.

317.1: Freedom
317.3: 7,
317.5: we
317.7: are
317.9: gonna
318.1: have
318.3: to
318.5: bleed
318.7: off
318.9: some
319.1: of
319.3: the
319.5: pressure

319.6: the
319.8: liquid
320.0: oxygen
320.2: tank

321.6: that
321.8: should
322.0: reduce
322.2: the
322.4: temperature
322.6: inside
322.8: the
323.0: capsule,
323.2: over

324.5: Any
325.0: day
325.2: now,
325.3: Capcom.

326.3: Fix
326.8: your
326.9: little
327.1: problem,
327.4: and
327.5: light
327.7: this
327.9: candle

328.5: Roger
329.1: that,
329.3: Freedom
329.6: 7.
329.8: Standby.

336.0: Move
336.3: to
336.6: final
336.9: countdown
337.1: sequence.

337.7: Moving
338.0: to
338.3: final
338.6: countdown
338.8: sequence.

339.3: Roger
339.5: that.

341.1: And
341.3: we
341.5: are
341.7: at
341.9: T-10..

343.2: 9...
344.0: 8...
345.2: 7...
346.8: 6...

348.9: ..
349.1: 5...
349.3: 4...

351.8: 3...
352.0: 2...

354.1: 1...
354.3: Zero!

359.1: We
359.3: have
359.5: ignition

361.0: And
361.4: we
361.6: have
361.8: liftoff!

363.0: Get
363.2: up
363.4: there

373.1: Get
373.3: on
373.5: up
373.7: there.

399.4: Trajectory
399.7: is
400.3: good.

403.8: Yaw
404.2: is
404.6: okay

405.8: Switching
406.1: to
406.5: manual
407.0: roll.

411.6: For
411.8: the
412.0: eyes
412.3: of
412.5: the
412.7: world

414.0: now
414.4: look
414.8: into
415.1: space,

415.6: to
416.0: the
416.4: moon
416.9: and
417.2: to
417.5: the
417.9: planets
418.1: beyond..

419.6: And
420.0: we
420.4: have
420.8: vowed...
421.2: that
421.9: we
422.6: shall
423.1: not
423.2: see
423.5: it
423.7: governed

424.1: by
424.5: a
424.9: hostile
425.5: flag
426.0: of
426.1: conquest,
426.3: but
426.5: by
426.7: a
426.9: banner

428.0: of
428.3: freedom
428.7: and
429.1: peace.
429.5: We
431.5: set
431.9: sail
432.2: on
432.5: this
432.9: new
433.1: sea,

434.2: because
435.1: there
435.3: is
435.5: new
435.7: knowledge
436.0: to
436.4: be
436.7: gained

437.4: and
437.6: new
437.9: rights
438.2: to
438.7: be
438.9: won

439.8: We
440.2: choose
440.5: to
440.9: go
441.1: to
441.3: the
441.5: Moon
441.9: in
442.0: this
442.2: decade
442.4: and
443.0: do
443.1: the
443.3: other
443.5: things

444.2: not
444.5: because
444.9: they
445.2: are
445.6: easy,
445.8: but
446.1: because
446.5: they
446.9: are
447.3: hard.

448.9: Suppose
449.3: we
449.5: should
449.5: all
449.7: thank
449.9: President
450.4: Kennedy
450.5: for
451.1: continued
451.7: job
452.0: security.

456.5: Gus
457.2: Grissom's
457.6: up
457.8: next.

458.0: Another
459.0: suborbital
459.7: flight
460.0: with
460.2: a
460.4: Redstone.

461.6: Our
462.0: last
462.2: shot
462.6: before
462.8: we
463.0: strap
463.3: Glenn
463.5: to
463.6: the
463.7: Atlas..

463.9: And..
464.9: Pray
465.7: we
465.9: can
466.1: brng
466.3: him
466.4: back
466.5: down.

466.7: Yes,
467.5: and
467.7: I
467.7: imagine
468.1: he
468.1: would
468.3: like
468.5: us
468.5: to
468.7: have
468.9: the
469.0: math
469.4: worked
469.7: out
469.9: beforehand.

471.9: Good
472.1: work,
472.7: gentlemen.

473.9: Go
474.2: have
474.5: dinner
474.7: with
474.9: your
475.0: kids.
475.2: Then...

476.3: let's
476.7: get
476.8: back
476.9: to
477.0: work.

510.5: I
510.9: think
511.0: it
511.2: is
511.4: high
511.5: time
511.6: that
511.7: I
511.9: kissed
512.2: you,
512.4: Kathe.

513.8: Oh.
514.0: And
514.2: why's
514.4: that?

518.4: Figure
518.6: you
518.9: are
519.2: attracted
519.4: to
519.6: me
519.6: the
519.7: same
520.1: as
520.3: I
520.5: to
520.7: you.

523.0: Is
523.4: that
523.5: right?

525.4: Or
525.9: you
525.9: would
525.9: have
526.0: told
526.3: me
526.5: to
526.5: get
526.7: going
527.0: a
527.1: long
527.2: time
527.4: ago.

542.6: Have
542.6: not
543.1: kissed
543.3: a
543.5: man
543.7: in
543.9: a
544.1: long
544.3: time.

546.1: Almost
546.3: forgot
546.5: how
546.7: to.

560.9: The
561.3: FBI
561.9: has
562.2: arrested
562.5: four
562.9: white
563.2: men
563.5: accused
564.0: of
564.1: throwing
564.3: a
564.5: fire

564.5: bomb
565.3: into
565.6: a
565.6: Freedom
565.9: Riders'
566.3: bus
566.6: south-side
567.0: of
567.3: Anniston,
567.8: Alabama.

569.2: Hi,
569.5: baby!
569.7: Hello!

577.6: The
578.0: kids
578.3: do
578.3: not
578.4: need
578.5: to
578.7: be
578.8: watching
579.0: this..
579.2: They
579.4: need
579.6: to
579.8: see
580.0: this

582.0: Everyone
582.9: needs
583.1: to
583.3: see
583.5: this.

589.5: We
590.0: think
590.2: we
590.4: are
590.6: rendering
591.1: a
591.2: great
591.6: service
591.8: to
592.0: our
592.2: nation.

592.8: For
593.5: this
593.7: is
593.9: not
594.2: a
594.3: struggle
594.5: for
594.9: ourselves
595.4: alone.

595.7: It
596.4: is
596.5: the
596.6: struggle
596.9: to
597.2: save
597.4: the
597.7: soul
597.8: of
598.0: America.

598.9: Mary
599.4: Jackson.

600.6: Petition
601.4: to
