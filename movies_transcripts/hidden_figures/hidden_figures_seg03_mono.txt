5.4: My
5.6: numbers
5.8: are
6.0: spot
6.2: on.

8.6: I
9.0: will
9.1: double
9.2: check
9.6: them,
9.8: sir.
10.1: No
10.3: problem.

20.7: I
20.7: am
21.1: not
21.3: gonna
21.5: be
21.6: able
21.7: to..
21.8: Work
21.9: on
22.0: what
22.1: you
22.2: can
22.3: read.

22.8: The
23.2: rest
23.5: is
23.7: classified.
24.3: You
24.4: do
24.4: not
24.6: have
24.7: clearance.

46.2: Excuse
46.7: me...

47.0: May
47.2: I
47.4: ask
47.6: you
47.8: where
48.0: the
48.2: ladies'
48.4: room
48.6: is?

48.4: Sorry,
49.3: I
49.6: have
49.9: no
50.1: idea
50.3: where
50.4: your
50.5: bathroom
50.9: is?

52.3: Yes,
52.8: sir.

54.1: Ah!
54.3: Yes.

139.9: Ruth!
140.1: Yes,
140.3: Mr.
140.5: Harrison.

142.6: Where
142.7: is
143.2: that
143.5: girl
143.6: with
143.8: the
144.0: numbers?

145.1: On
145.5: a...
145.6: break.

148.4: We
148.8: take
149.0: breaks
149.3: now?

177.3: My
177.8: God,
178.1: where
178.4: have
178.5: you
178.7: been?
178.8: Are
179.0: you
179.2: finished
179.4: yet?

180.6: Almost.
180.8: He
181.0: said
181.2: about
181.4: the
181.6: end
181.8: of
182.0: the
182.2: day?

182.6: The
182.8: end
183.3: of
183.4: the
183.5: day
183.6: around
183.8: here
183.9: was
184.2: yesterday.

186.2: I
186.4: need
186.7: those
186.8: done
187.0: first.

187.2: He
187.4: wants
187.6: those
187.8: done
188.0: first.

188.6: OK!
188.8: Get
189.0: going.

259.6: Mr.
260.1: Harrison.

262.3: Oh!
262.4: Yeah,
263.2: just
263.4: set
263.6: up,
263.8: you
264.0: know.

267.4: And
267.5: Stafford's
268.5: heat
268.6: shield
268.8: calcs?

271.0: It
271.0: is
271.6: hard
271.9: to
272.0: be
272.1: sure,
272.3: sir.

273.7: Hard
273.9: to
274.1: be
274.3: sure.

275.9: You
276.0: know
276.1: what
276.3: we
276.4: are
276.6: doing
276.7: here?

279.3: Trying
279.8: to
279.8: put
280.0: a
280.1: man
280.3: into
280.5: space,
280.7: sir.

281.1: That
281.3: is
281.5: right.

283.4: That
283.5: is
284.0: right.
284.1: So
284.3: you
284.4: can
284.5: throw
284.6: that
284.8: in
285.0: the
285.0: trash.

285.6: Excuse
286.3: me?

287.2: I
287.5: said
288.0: you
288.2: can
288.3: throw
288.6: it
288.7: away

290.0: Here.

292.0: It
292.3: is
292.6: not
292.7: an
292.9: insult
293.1: to
293.2: your
293.4: work.
293.6: It
293.8: is
294.0: just..

294.4: ..
294.5: Obsolete.
294.9: That
295.4: is
295.6: how
295.7: fast
296.1: things
296.2: are
296.5: moving
296.7: around
296.9: here.

297.6: If
297.8: I
298.0: said
298.2: I
298.4: was
298.6: sorry,
298.8: I
299.0: would
299.2: be
299.4: saying
299.6: it
299.8: all
300.0: day.

301.0: What
301.2: I
301.5: am
301.7: asking
302.0: you
302.1: to
302.2: do..
302.3: What
302.5: I
302.7: am
302.9: asking
303.1: everyone
303.5: in
303.7: that
303.9: room,

304.3: all
304.8: my...
305.3: geniuses,
305.8: is
306.4: to
306.6: look
306.8: beyond
307.2: the
307.4: numbers.

308.6: To
308.8: look
309.2: around
309.4: them.

311.0: Through
311.4: them.

312.7: For
312.8: answers
313.2: to
313.6: questions
313.7: we
313.9: do
314.2: not
314.3: even
314.4: know
314.5: to
314.7: ask.

315.7: Math
316.3: that
316.4: does
316.4: not
316.7: yet
316.9: exist.

318.3: Because
318.9: without
319.2: it,
319.3: we
319.3: are
319.4: not
319.5: going
319.8: anywhere.

320.4: I
320.6: mean,
320.8: we
321.0: are
321.3: staying
321.5: on
321.7: the
321.9: ground.
322.1: We
322.3: are
322.5: not...

323.0: flying
323.4: into
323.8: space.
324.0: We
324.2: are
324.4: not..

324.7: Circling
324.8: the
325.0: earth.
325.1: And
325.3: we
325.5: are
326.0: certainly
326.3: not
326.4: touching
326.7: the
327.1: moon.
327.2: And
327.4: in
327.6: my
327.7: mind..

329.8: In
329.9: my
330.4: mind,
330.8: I
330.8: am
330.9: already
331.1: there.

334.4: Are
334.9: you?

337.0: Yes,
337.6: sir.

339.0: Good.

340.4: Because
341.0: I
341.0: do
341.0: not
341.2: need
341.4: another
341.6: smart
342.0: girl
342.2: with
342.3: an
342.4: adding
342.7: machine.

346.4: Can
346.9: I
347.1: go,
347.3: sir?

350.6: Go?
350.8: Yeah.
351.0: Go,
351.2: yeah.

353.8: Yes,
354.7: you
354.8: can
355.0: go

379.7: I
379.9: am
380.1: saying
380.3: this
380.5: is
380.7: so
380.9: much.
381.1: I
381.3: am
381.5: not
381.7: saying
381.9: that..
382.1: I..

387.0: We
387.0: have
387.4: been
387.5: waiting
387.7: for
387.9: hours.

388.0: Next
388.8: time
389.0: you
389.1: take
389.2: the
389.4: bus.

389.8: She
389.9: is
390.5: in
390.6: a
390.7: mood.

410.0: I
410.2: have
410.4: not
410.6: been
410.8: late
411.0: one
411.4: day
411.7: in
412.0: ten
412.3: years.
412.5: Have
412.8: not
413.1: been
413.4: out
413.5: sick.

414.2: Have
414.2: not
414.7: complained.
415.2: My
415.7: work's
416.2: on
416.2: time.
416.4: It
416.6: is
416.8: done
417.0: right.
417.2: It
417.4: is
417.6: done
417.8: well.

418.0: It
418.2: is
418.5: not
418.7: fair,
418.8: that
419.0: is
419.2: a
419.3: fact.

419.5: What
419.8: is
420.1: not
420.3: fair
420.5: is
420.7: having
420.9: the
421.2: responsibility
421.3: of
421.5: the
421.7: Supervisor,

422.0: but
422.7: not
422.8: the
423.0: title
423.2: or
423.4: the
423.6: pay.

424.9: Watching
425.1: you
425.3: two
425.5: move
425.7: on.

427.3: Now
427.7: do
427.7: not
427.8: get
427.9: me
428.0: wrong.

429.0: Any
429.3: upward
429.7: movement
430.1: is
430.3: movement
430.6: for
430.8: us
431.0: all

432.9: It
433.1: just
433.3: is
433.5: not
433.7: movement
433.9: for
434.1: me.

434.1: Truth
435.1: be
435.2: told,
435.2: Dorothy,
435.6: I
436.0: do
436.0: not
436.2: really
436.5: know
436.6: if
436.7: I
436.8: can
436.9: keep
437.2: up
437.3: in
437.6: that
437.7: room.

439.1: I
439.3: will
439.5: be
439.7: back
439.9: with
440.1: the
440.3: Computers
440.5: in
440.7: a
440.9: week,

441.9: or
441.9: out
441.9: of
441.9: a
442.0: job
443.1: entirely.

443.6: Oh,
443.8: please!
444.0: You
444.2: are
444.4: better
444.6: with
444.8: the
445.0: numbers
445.2: than
445.4: anyone
445.6: in
445.8: the
446.0: cabin
446.2: and
446.4: you
446.6: know
446.8: it.

447.6: Make
448.5: that
448.6: pencil
449.0: move
449.2: as
449.4: fast
449.6: as
449.8: your
449.9: mind
450.1: does,
450.3: you
450.3: will
450.4: be
450.5: fine.

451.5: And
451.9: you.
452.2: Have
453.2: some
453.4: respect!
453.6: Get
453.8: your
454.0: damn
454.2: feet
454.4: off
454.6: my
454.8: dash
455.0: board.

455.3: This
455.5: is
455.7: not
455.9: your
456.2: living
456.5: room.

460.9: I
461.3: sound
461.7: like
461.7: a
461.9: supervisor,
462.1: do
462.3: not
462.5: I?

462.8: A
463.0: mean,
463.2: ole
463.4: salty
463.6: one.

464.1: Riddled
465.1: with
465.2: authority.
465.5: No
465.9: question.

467.8: You
468.4: do
468.4: not
468.6: mess
468.8: with,
469.0: Mrs.
469.2: Vaughan.

470.8: Turn
471.0: that
471.2: music
471.4: up

488.7: Goodnight,
488.9: Katherine!
489.1: Bye,
489.3: Kath!

491.2: Goodnight,
491.4: ladies!
491.7: See
491.9: you
492.2: in
492.9: the
493.1: morning.

502.5: Hey
502.9: baby
503.3: Hello,
503.5: mamma.

505.0: I
505.1: was
505.2: fixing
506.3: to
506.4: call
506.4: the
506.8: National
507.2: Guard.

509.2: Sorry,
509.4: Momma.

510.8: New
511.3: assignment.

513.1: Space
513.6: Task
513.8: Group.

513.9: Oh
514.5: my
515.2: word,
515.7: that
515.8: sounds
516.0: important

517.2: It
517.3: is
517.8: a
517.8: promotion?

519.8: Might
520.3: be
520.4: a
520.5: slight
520.9: promotion.

522.5: But
523.0: you
523.1: want
523.3: the
523.5: job,
523.6: right?

525.7: I
525.8: think
526.5: so.

527.3: It
527.4: is
527.5: a
527.7: challenge.
527.9: But..

529.3: Well,
529.5: it
529.7: is
530.0: nothing
530.3: you
530.5: can
530.5: not
530.7: handle,
530.8: Katherine.

533.5: Thank
534.0: you,
534.2: mamma.

536.7: Are
537.0: they
537.3: asleep
537.4: yet?
537.7: They
538.0: are
538.4: pretending
538.9: to
539.2: be.

541.9: They
541.9: are
541.9: not
542.0: pretending
542.2: well
542.4: enough

544.8: Thank
545.0: you,
545.2: mamma.
545.4: Love
545.6: you.

546.6: This
547.5: is
547.7: my
547.9: bed!

552.1: What
552.3: are
552.5: you
552.7: doing?

553.3: It
553.5: is
553.8: not
554.1: fair
554.6: how
554.9: Joylette
555.2: gets
555.6: to
555.8: sleep
556.0: by
556.1: herself
556.4: cause
556.8: she
557.2: is
557.6: the
557.8: oldest.

558.0: Yes
558.2: it
558.4: is
558.6: fair

561.3: Constance,
561.5: Kathy,
561.7: sit.

567.7: Now,
568.2: I
568.9: understand
569.8: you
570.5: want
570.8: to
570.9: be
571.1: grown.
571.4: And
572.0: have
572.3: your
572.5: own
572.6: space

573.8: So
574.2: whoever
574.6: sleeps
575.0: in
575.2: that
575.4: bed,

575.5: in
576.1: Joylette's
576.7: place,

577.2: will
578.0: also
578.4: do
578.7: the
578.7: dishes,

579.5: take
579.8: out
580.0: the
580.2: trash,
580.7: and
581.2: do
581.4: all
582.0: of
582.2: Joylette's
582.4: chores

583.8: That
584.0: is
584.2: okay.
584.4: Never
584.6: mind.

585.8: She
586.0: is
586.2: not
586.4: so
586.6: terrible
586.8: to
587.0: share
587.2: with.

590.4: OK.

591.7: Then
591.8: do
591.8: not
592.4: let
592.5: me
592.6: come
592.8: home
593.0: and
593.3: find
593.4: you
593.5: like
593.8: this
593.8: again,
594.0: you
594.2: hear
594.4: me?

594.8: You
595.0: are
595.3: supposed
595.8: to
595.8: been
596.1: asleep,
596.5: a
596.9: long
597.1: time
597.3: ago.

597.4: We
598.3: just
598.5: wanted
598.8: to
598.9: say
599.0: goodnight.

599.4: You
599.4: have
600.3: been
600.4: gone
600.6: for
600.9: 300
601.9: hours.

604.4: I
604.6: work
604.8: a
605.0: full-time
605.2: job
605.4: now.
605.6: You
605.8: all
606.0: know
606.2: that.
