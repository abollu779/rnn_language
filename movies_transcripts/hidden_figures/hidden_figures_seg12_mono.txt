27.0: The
28.8: heat
29.1: shield
29.3: may

38.3: He
38.5: could

39.0: up
39.0: on
39.2: re-entry.

48.9: Come
49.4: on,
49.6: babies!

50.8: There
51.0: is
51.2: a
51.4: man
51.6: in
51.8: space.
52.0: We
52.2: do
52.4: not
52.6: want
52.8: to
53.0: miss
53.2: it,
53.4: so
53.6: we
53.8: gonna
54.0: home.

53.7: Something's
53.9: wrong
54.1: with
54.3: Glenn.

54.9: Oh,
55.1: my
55.3: Goodness!
55.5: What
55.7: is
55.9: going

56.5: Let's
56.7: go.
56.9: Ya
57.1: will
57.3: follow
57.5: me.

60.3: We
60.4: have
60.6: just
60.9: learned,
61.5: the
61.6: Friendship
62.1: 7
62.4: is
63.2: in
63.3: danger
63.6: of
63.9: losing
64.1: its
64.8: heat
65.3: shield.

65.7: Have
66.3: you
66.5: heard
66.7: any
66.9: banging
67.3: noises?
67.5: Or
67.7: anything
67.9: of
68.1: this
68.3: type
68.5: at
68.7: higher
68.9: rates?

69.7: That
69.7: is
70.0: a
70.3: negative,
70.5: Capcom.

73.1: Tell
73.3: him
73.5: not
73.7: to
73.9: jettison
74.1: the
74.3: retro-package.

75.1: Tell
75.3: him
75.5: not
75.7: to
75.9: jettison
76.1: the
76.3: retro-package.

77.6: NASA
78.0: is
78.4: confirming
78.9: there
79.0: is
79.2: some
79.4: sort
79.6: of
79.7: malfunction
79.9: with
80.5: the
80.7: capsule's
80.9: heat
81.1: shield,

81.4: and
81.6: it
81.8: may
82.0: not
82.2: stay
82.4: in
82.6: place.

83.3: If
83.5: the
83.7: heat
83.9: shield
84.1: is
84.3: loose...
84.5: The
84.7: retro
84.9: package
85.1: straps
85.3: might
85.5: hold
85.7: it
85.9: in
86.1: place.

88.9: Will
89.7: that
89.9: work?
90.2: It
90.4: will
90.6: work.

92.2: It
92.5: will
92.8: hold
93.0: it
93.2: until
93.5: he
93.7: reaches
94.0: the
94.1: Go
94.3: /No
94.4: Go
94.6: point.
94.9: It
95.2: will
95.6: work!

97.4: He
97.8: has
97.9: to
98.0: override
98.6: the
98.8: 05g.

100.1: Do
100.3: it.

101.9: Friendship
102.7: 7...

103.3: We
103.3: are
103.7: recommending
104.0: that
104.5: the
104.8: retro-package
105.4: NOT,
106.1: I
106.5: repeat,
106.8: NOT
107.2: be
107.4: jettisoned.

108.6: This
109.0: means
109.4: that
109.4: you
109.6: will
109.7: have
110.1: to
110.2: override
110.7: the
111.2: 05g
111.8: switch.

112.4: Roger!
113.1: Is
114.1: there
114.4: a
114.5: reason
114.8: for
114.9: this?
115.1: Over.

115.9: Standby,
116.6: 7.

122.4: Not
122.9: at
123.0: this
123.0: time,
123.2: 7.

125.0: Roger,
125.7: that
125.8: command.
126.3: I
126.6: will
126.9: make
127.1: a
127.2: manual
127.4: 05g
127.6: entry,

129.4: and
129.9: bring
130.0: the
130.1: scope
130.4: in.
130.6: Over.

135.0: He
135.2: knows.

144.2: Without
144.5: a
144.8: heat
145.1: shield,
145.2: there
145.5: is
145.7: no
145.9: way
146.1: a
146.3: Colonel
146.5: Glenn

146.7: can
146.9: get
147.1: back
147.3: through
147.5: the
147.7: Earth's
147.9: atmosphere.

149.0: The
149.2: heat
149.4: is
149.6: simply
149.8: too
150.0: overpowering.
150.2: A
150.4: malfunction
150.6: in
150.8: the
151.0: automatic
151.2: control
151.4: system

153.7: is
153.9: causing
154.2: the
154.3: spacecraft
154.5: to
154.7: yaw
154.9: in
155.1: a
155.3: skid
155.5: like
155.7: fashion

157.1: thus
157.6: putting
157.8: the
158.0: Friendship
158.5: 7's
159.0: re-entry
159.5: point
159.6: in
159.8: jeopardy

161.2: even
161.7: now,
161.9: col.
162.1: Glen
162.3: is
162.5: skidding
162.7: towards
162.9: the
163.1: US

164.8: and
165.2: he
165.4: must
165.7: begin
166.0: the
166.2: retro
166.4: sequence

180.3: You
180.3: are
180.6: going
180.9: to
181.2: be
181.3: using
181.5: fly-by-wire
182.6: for
183.0: reentry.

183.8: You
184.0: will
184.2: need
184.4: to
184.5: maintain
184.7: a
185.0: zero
185.3: angle.
185.4: Over.

186.6: Roger.
187.3: I
187.3: am
187.8: on
187.9: fly-by-wire,
188.6: back-it
189.4: up
189.4: with
189.5: manual.
190.0: Over.

191.2: Keep
191.7: talking
191.9: to
192.1: him.

192.5: Roger.
192.7: The
193.0: weather

193.6: the
193.9: recovery
195.5: 3
196.5: foot
196.6: waves,

197.4: miles
197.7: visibility.

199.2: Capcom,

200.9: He
200.9: is
201.3: crossing
201.6: the
201.8: communication
202.1: black-out
202.5: zone.

205.9: There
206.0: is
206.2: a
206.4: real
206.6: fireball
207.1: outside,
207.2: and
207.3: it
207.5: is
207.6: getting
207.7: a
207.9: little
208.0: hot
208.2: here!

252.5: Friendship

278.8: Over.

292.4: Loud
292.9: and
293.0: clear,
293.1: Capcom.

294.7: Roger
295.2: that.
295.8: How
296.3: are
296.4: you
296.5: doing?

298.6: My
299.0: condition
299.2: is
299.5: good.
299.6: But
299.8: that
299.9: was
300.1: a
300.3: real
300.5: fireball,
301.0: boy

301.3: Roger

302.3: Let's

307.7: Approaching
