20.0: Colonel
20.3: Glenn's
20.7: launch
21.1: coordinates
21.5: accounting
22.0: for
22.1: the
22.2: window
22.5: change,
22.7: sir.

22.8: I
23.6: have
23.8: told
24.1: you
24.3: Computers
25.0: do
25.0: not
25.2: author
25.4: reports.
25.6: Fix
25.8: it.

25.8: Those
26.6: are
26.7: my
26.8: calculations.
27.2: My
27.7: name
27.9: should
28.1: be
28.3: on
28.5: it.

28.2: But
28.4: it
28.7: is
28.9: not
29.0: the
29.2: way
29.3: this
29.5: works.

30.5: Paul.
30.5: What
30.6: is
31.4: happening
32.2: here?

32.3: Mr.
33.0: Harrison,
33.5: I
33.9: would
34.1: like
34.3: to
34.4: attend
34.7: today's
35.0: briefing.

35.4: Why's
36.2: that?
36.2: Well,
36.2: sir,
36.2: the
36.2: data
36.3: changes
37.7: so
37.8: fast.

38.2: The
38.6: capsule
39.0: changes.
39.4: The
39.8: weight
40.1: and
40.3: the
40.5: landing
40.7: zones
40.8: are
41.0: all
41.2: changing
41.7: everyday.

42.7: I
43.0: do
43.3: my
43.4: work,
43.6: you
44.1: attend
44.4: these
44.6: briefings.
44.8: I
45.1: have
45.3: to
45.6: start
45.8: all
46.0: over.

46.6: Colonel
47.1: Glenn
47.4: launches
47.7: in
47.9: a
47.9: few
48.1: weeks.

49.1: We
49.5: do
49.5: not
49.7: have
49.8: the
49.9: math
50.1: figured
50.4: out
50.6: yet.

51.6: Why
52.0: is
52.1: it
52.2: she
52.3: can
52.4: not
52.5: attend?
52.8: Because
53.1: she
53.4: does
53.4: not
53.4: have
53.6: clearance,
53.8: Al.

54.1: I
54.4: can
54.7: not
55.0: do
55.3: my
55.3: work
55.6: effectively
56.1: if
56.2: I
56.4: do
56.5: not
56.7: have
56.9: all
57.0: of
57.2: the
57.4: data,

57.2: and
57.9: all
58.0: of
58.1: the
58.3: information
58.6: as
59.0: soon
59.1: as
59.2: it
59.3: is
59.5: available.

59.4: I
59.9: need
60.1: to
60.2: be
60.3: in
60.4: that
60.5: room,
60.8: hearing
61.0: what
61.2: you
61.4: hear.

61.2: Pentagon
61.7: Briefings
62.3: are
62.4: not
62.5: for
62.7: civilians.
63.4: It
63.5: requires
63.8: the
63.9: highest
64.1: clearance.

64.4: I
64.8: feel
65.0: like
65.0: I
65.1: am
65.2: the
65.3: best
65.6: person
65.8: to
66.0: present
66.2: my
66.4: calculations

66.1: You
66.3: are
66.5: not
66.7: gonna
66.9: let
67.1: this
67.3: go
67.5: are
67.7: you?
67.9: No,
68.1: I
68.3: am
68.5: not

68.0: Let
68.1: her
68.2: in?
68.3: She
68.6: is
69.0: a
69.3: woman.
69.7: There
69.9: is
70.1: no
70.5: protocol
70.8: for
71.0: a
71.2: woman
71.4: attending.

71.5: Okay,
71.7: I
71.9: get
72.1: that
72.3: part,
72.5: Paul.

76.2: But
76.7: within
77.2: these
77.8: walls,
78.3: who...
78.9: makes
79.4: the
79.6: rules?

80.0: You,
80.3: sir.
80.7: You
81.0: are
81.4: the
81.7: boss.
82.1: You
82.5: just
82.7: have
82.8: to
82.8: act
83.2: like
83.2: one.
83.4: Sir.

94.1: You
94.4: keep
94.6: quiet.

96.1: Thank
96.6: you.

97.9: Good
98.1: morning.

100.2: Gentlemen

110.5: This
110.9: is
111.0: Katherine
111.3: Goble
111.7: with
111.9: our
112.0: Trajectory
112.2: and
112.7: Launch
113.0: Window
113.2: Division.

114.8: Her
115.1: work
115.4: is
115.4: pertinent
115.8: to
115.9: today's
116.1: proceedings.

118.3: Come
119.1: on.
120.0: Go
120.9: get
121.0: her
121.1: a
121.2: chair.

123.3: We
123.6: have
123.7: a
123.8: confirmed
124.0: launch
124.2: window..

124.5: Give
124.7: her
124.9: your
125.1: chair.
125.3: Yes,
125.5: sir.

126.1: We
126.3: have
126.5: a
126.7: confirmed
126.9: launch
127.2: window
127.7: for
128.0: friendship
128.4: 7.
128.7: Let's
129.0: discuss
129.2: a
129.4: landing
129.6: zone.

130.2: The
130.6: Navy
130.9: needs
131.2: a
131.3: singular
131.5: landing
131.7: zone.

132.3: 20
132.7: miles
133.2: square
133.3: is
133.5: what
133.7: we
133.9: can
134.1: service
134.3: for
134.5: retrieval.

135.3: Outside
135.9: of
136.1: that,
136.2: we
136.5: risk
136.8: the
137.2: capsule's
137.6: recovery.

138.2: We
138.2: would
138.7: like
138.8: 3
139.1: possible
139.7: recovery
139.9: areas.

140.4: We
140.8: can
140.8: not
141.1: cover
141.3: half
141.6: the
141.7: damn
142.0: ocean.

142.8: With
143.2: all
143.3: due
143.5: respect,
143.6: our
144.1: capsule's
144.7: being
145.0: altered
145.2: daily.

146.6: We
146.6: are
146.6: orbiting
147.0: the
147.4: Earth
147.5: at...
147.8: what
147.9: is
148.0: the
148.1: speed
148.4: now?

155.2: 17,544
155.4: miles
155.6: per
155.8: hour.

157.8: At
158.0: the
158.3: time
158.4: the
158.6: rocket
158.8: delivers
159.1: the
159.3: capsule
159.6: into
160.0: low
160.1: space
160.5: orbit.

164.5: That
164.6: is
165.1: one
165.2: hell
165.3: of
165.4: a
165.5: speeding
165.7: ticket.

168.6: OK.
169.7: So
170.2: we
170.3: have
170.4: the
170.6: vehicle's
170.9: speed,

171.1: the
171.4: launch
171.6: window
172.2: and
172.6: for
173.0: argument's
173.6: sake,
173.8: the
174.0: landing
174.2: zone
174.4: is
174.6: The
174.8: Bahamas.

175.8: Should
176.2: be
176.5: enough
176.6: to
176.7: figure
176.8: the
176.9: Go/No
177.1: Go?

177.9: Yeah!
178.0: In
178.4: theory,
178.8: sir.
179.1: We
179.7: need
179.9: to
179.9: be
180.2: past
180.5: theory
180.8: at
181.0: this
181.2: point.

181.1: We
181.1: will
181.3: be
181.4: able
181.5: to
181.6: calculate
181.9: a
182.0: Go/No
182.2: Go
182.7: with
183.1: that
183.3: information.

184.0: When
184.5: exactly
184.9: is
185.3: that
185.5: gonna
185.7: happen?

197.4: Katherine.

200.8: Have
201.2: a
201.3: go
201.4: at
201.6: it?

227.5: The
227.8: Go
228.2: point
228.7: for
228.9: re-entry

230.2: is
230.5: 2,990
232.5: miles

234.0: from
234.2: where
234.4: we
234.6: want
234.8: Colonel
235.0: Glenn
235.2: to
235.4: land.

236.7: If
237.2: we
237.3: assume
237.6: that
237.7: is
237.9: The
238.1: Bahamas.

239.7: At
239.7: 17,544
243.3: miles
244.0: per
244.2: hour..

245.1: Upon
245.3: reentry..

246.9: 370..

248.9: At
249.1: a
249.3: descent
249.5: angle..

250.9: Of
251.1: 46.56
251.3: ..

254.4: Degrees..
254.6: Distance..

291.5: OK!
291.5: So,
292.4: that
292.6: puts
292.7: the
292.9: landing
293.1: zone
293.3: at...

293.2: 25.0667
296.9: North,

297.2: 77.3333
297.4: West.

301.8: Which
302.3: is
302.4: here

306.4: Right
306.9: here.
306.9: Give
307.0: or
307.0: take
307.1: 20
309.6: square
309.8: miles.

315.4: I
315.7: like
315.9: her
316.0: numbers.

318.0: Thank
318.5: you.

320.3: That
320.7: of
320.8: course
320.8: is
321.1: assuming
321.4: the
321.7: ..
322.1: Capsule
322.5: hits
322.9: the
323.3: reentry
323.8: point
324.1: exactly

325.0: How
325.5: do
325.6: we
325.8: insure
326.0: that?

327.9: That
328.3: is
328.5: the
328.5: math
328.9: we
329.0: do
329.0: not
329.2: have
329.4: yet,
329.6: gentlemen.

330.2: We
330.2: are
330.3: working
331.0: on
331.2: it.

334.0: Katherine

338.9: What
339.2: is
339.3: it
339.5: gonna
339.7: take
339.8: to
340.0: make
340.1: this
340.3: thing
340.5: worth
340.7: the
340.8: price
341.1: tag?

341.2: We
341.2: are
341.8: just
342.0: getting
342.2: up
342.3: to
342.4: speed
342.6: here,
343.0: Mr.
343.2: Harrison.

343.8: I
344.1: need
344.3: more
344.5: man
344.7: power.

345.0: I
345.2: mean
345.4: Programmers.
345.6: Folks
345.8: to
346.0: feed
346.2: the
346.4: cards.

346.8: Then
347.0: get
347.2: them,
347.4: for
347.9: crying
348.2: out
348.3: loud.
348.5: Right?

349.6: You
349.8: are
350.1: the
350.2: IBM
350.6: man,
350.8: right?
351.0: Yes,
351.2: sir.

351.7: Pull
351.8: them
352.0: out
352.2: of
352.3: the
352.5: sky
352.7: if
352.9: you
353.0: have
353.1: to,
353.3: but
353.5: let's
353.7: get
353.9: ahead
354.1: of

354.2: this
354.4: thing.
354.6: Or
354.8: I
355.0: am
355.2: not
355.4: paying
355.6: you.
355.8: Understood

361.0: I
361.2: got
361.4: that
361.5: one

363.6: I
363.6: am
364.0: not
364.1: paying
364.4: any
364.6: of
364.8: you!

375.0: Me?
375.5: Temporarily.
375.7: Yes.

377.8: We
378.2: need
378.3: the
378.5: IBM
378.9: for
379.1: Glenn's
379.3: launch.

380.1: The
380.1: Lead
380.6: Engineer
381.1: says
381.3: you
381.3: are
381.4: good
381.5: with
381.6: the
381.7: cards,
382.2: programming
382.8: and
383.0: such.

384.1: What
384.5: about
384.6: the
384.8: girls
385.1: here?

385.1: Human
386.4: computers
386.9: can
387.0: not
387.1: calculate
387.4: an
387.7: orbital
388.0: flight
388.4: in
388.5: the
388.6: time
388.9: we
389.0: have.

390.0: They
390.0: will
390.4: stay
390.6: put
390.9: for
391.0: now.
391.0: What
392.2: about
392.3: after
392.5: "now"?

394.0: After
394.7: the
395.5: Glenn
396.3: launch,
396.6: NASA's
397.0: dissolvin'
397.4: the
397.9: Computing
398.1: Groups.

401.3: I
401.3: am
401.7: not
401.9: accepting
402.4: reassignment.

403.2: Unless,
403.7: I
403.8: bring
403.9: my
404.1: ladies
404.3: with
404.5: me.

406.0: Excuse
406.8: me?

407.2: We
407.2: are
407.2: going
407.2: to
407.2: need

407.7: lot
408.2: of
408.3: manpower
408.6: to
408.9: program
409.1: that
409.3: beast.

409.4: I
410.3: can
410.3: not
410.6: do
410.7: it
410.8: alone.
411.0: My
411.2: girls
411.4: are
411.6: ready

412.8: They
413.2: can
413.4: do
413.5: the
413.6: work.

418.2: Ladies!
421.8: We
421.8: have
422.2: been
422.4: reassigned.

424.8: Leave
424.9: your
425.1: calculators.
425.3: You
426.1: will
426.1: not
426.2: need
426.3: them
426.5: where
426.7: we
426.7: are
426.8: going.

487.9: Welcome,
488.4: ladies!

499.8: Do
499.9: you
500.3: know

500.8: is,
501.0: Paul?

503.4: To
503.4: find
503.7: the
504.0: genius
504.5: among
504.6: those
504.9: geniuses.

505.7: To
505.9: pull
506.1: us
506.6: all
506.9: up.

508.4: We
508.7: all
509.0: get
509.3: to
509.6: the
509.9: peak
510.2: together,
510.5: or
510.8: we..
511.2: Do
511.2: not
511.5: get
511.8: there
512.0: at
512.2: all.

516.2: Yes.
516.7: Well.
517.5: Good
518.2: night,
518.3: sir.

547.7: I
548.1: do
548.1: not
548.3: know
548.4: what
548.6: time
548.7: I
548.8: am
549.0: coming
549.0: home.

549.7: The
549.9: class
550.1: ends
550.3: at
550.5: 9.

554.7: You
555.3: got
555.5: something
555.7: to
555.8: say?
