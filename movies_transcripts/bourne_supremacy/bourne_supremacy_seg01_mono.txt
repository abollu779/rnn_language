8.7: This
8.9: is
9.1: not
9.3: a
9.5: drill,
9.7: soldier.

12.1: We

12.7: on
12.8: that?

15.7: This
15.9: is
16.1: a
16.3: live
16.6: project,
16.8: and
17.0: you
17.2: are
17.4: a
17.6: go.

18.9: You

26.1: Training
26.3: is
26.5: over.

75.0: I
75.0: am
75.0: okay.
75.3: It
75.7: is
76.0: fine.

78.3: It
78.5: is
78.7: just
78.9: a
79.1: headache.

85.6: You
85.6: are
86.0: burning
86.2: up.

102.2: It
102.2: is
102.3: okay.

105.8: Just
106.0: a
106.2: headache.

128.8: Anything
129.5: new?

130.2: No.

133.6: It
133.6: is
133.7: just
134.2: bits
134.4: and
134.5: pieces.

138.3: I
138.6: can
138.8: hear
138.9: Conklin's
139.0: voice

141.5: and
141.5: there

142.3: but...

146.2: I
146.7: just
146.9: can
146.9: not
147.1: stay
147.2: with
147.5: it.

148.5: But
148.9: you
148.9: are
149.2: sure
149.2: it
149.2: is
149.7: not
149.9: just
150.1: a
150.3: bad
150.5: dream?

150.2: It
150.9: happened.
151.6: It
152.3: was
152.4: a
152.5: mission.

156.1: And
156.1: I
156.5: was
156.7: there.

158.0: You
158.4: should
158.6: write
158.7: it
158.9: down.

163.4: Now,
164.0: two
164.2: years
164.3: we
164.5: are
164.7: scribbling
165.2: in
165.3: that
165.5: notebook.

166.0: It
166.2: has
166.4: not
166.6: been
166.8: two
167.0: years.
167.2: It
167.4: is
167.6: always
167.8: bad

167.8: and
168.0: now
168.2: it
168.4: is
168.6: just
168.8: the
169.0: same
169.2: thing
169.4: over
169.6: and
169.8: over
170.0: again.

170.0: But
170.2: that
170.4: is
170.6: why
170.7: we
170.9: write
171.0: it
171.1: down.

172.3: Because
172.8: sooner
173.1: or

173.3: you
173.6: remember
174.0: something
174.3: good.
