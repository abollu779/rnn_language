87.8: Two
88.2: men
88.5: dead.

90.3: Three
90.8: million
91.1: in
91.1: cash
91.5: gone,
91.8: no
92.1: Neski
92.2: files

93.8: and
94.0: all
94.3: very
94.6: public.

95.6: This
96.0: is
96.2: still
96.3: a
96.5: clandestine
97.1: agency,
97.3: no?

98.3: I
98.6: do
98.6: not
98.9: view
99.0: this
99.2: event
99.7: as
99.9: a
99.9: failure.

100.2: You
100.6: call
100.6: it
100.8: a
101.1: success?

102.1: We
102.5: have
102.7: a
102.8: lead.

103.3: A
103.3: fingerprint
104.2: left
104.3: by
104.5: the
104.6: assassin.

106.6: It
106.6: is
106.8: one
107.0: of
107.2: us.

109.4: Who
109.6: is
109.8: it?

111.0: What
111.3: can
111.5: you
111.5: tell
111.7: me
111.8: about
112.0: Treadstone?

114.0: Treadstone?

115.3: That
115.5: is
115.7: where
115.9: the
116.1: trail
116.3: dead-ends.

117.0: If
117.3: you
117.6: want
117.9: an
118.2: answer,
118.5: you
118.9: are
119.3: going
119.3: to
119.4: have
119.5: to
119.7: give
119.9: me

120.1: a
120.3: level
120.5: five
120.7: SCI
120.9: access.

125.7: We
126.1: have
126.3: a
126.4: lead,
126.7: Marty.

130.4: All
130.6: right.

132.7: You
132.7: have
132.8: got
133.3: your
133.5: clearance.

134.1: But
134.6: you
135.1: are
135.6: on
136.2: a
136.3: very
136.4: short
136.6: leash.

137.6: And
137.7: you
137.8: will
137.9: give
138.0: a
138.1: full
138.3: report
138.5: to
138.8: the
138.9: group.

139.3: I
139.6: wanna
140.0: know
140.1: where
140.4: you
140.4: are
140.6: going
141.0: with
141.1: this.

142.4: Sir.

222.4: Ward?
222.6: Yes?

223.9: Pamela
224.1: Landy.

225.0: Hey,
225.4: Pam.
225.8: What
227.0: can
227.1: I
227.1: do
227.3: for
227.5: you?

227.4: I
227.7: was
227.8: hoping
228.0: you
228.1: had
228.2: some
228.3: time
228.5: for
228.7: me.

228.8: Time
229.0: for
229.2: what?

230.0: I
230.0: am
230.4: free
230.6: right
230.7: now,
230.9: actually.

231.4: That
231.8: sounds
232.0: ominous.

233.5: Let
233.9: me
234.0: check
234.1: my
234.2: schedule.

239.0: Excuse
239.2: me,
239.4: I
239.6: need
239.8: to...

240.2: Excuse
240.7: me.
240.9: Can
241.1: I
241.2: help
241.4: you?

241.7: Yeah,
241.9: I
242.1: am
242.3: here
242.5: to
242.7: see
242.9: Mr.
243.1: Abbott.

243.7: 20
243.9: minutes?
244.1: See
244.3: you.

255.4: Operation
256.2: Treadstone.

256.9: Never
257.1: heard
257.3: of
257.5: it.

258.2: That
258.4: is
258.6: not
258.8: gonna
259.0: fly.

259.2: With
259.6: all
259.7: due
259.9: respect,
260.2: Pam,
260.6: I
260.8: think
261.0: you
261.2: might

261.3: have
261.4: wandered
261.6: a
261.7: little
261.9: past
262.1: your
262.3: pay
262.6: grade.

263.4: That
263.6: is
263.8: a
264.0: warrant
264.2: from
264.4: Director
264.6: Marshall

265.0: granting
265.7: me
265.9: unrestricted
266.2: access

266.5: to
266.6: all
266.8: personnel
266.9: and
267.1: materials
267.4: associated
267.7: with
268.0: Treadstone.

273.3: So,
273.5: what
273.7: are
273.9: we
274.1: looking
274.3: at?

275.8: I
276.0: wanna
276.2: know
276.4: about
276.6: it.

276.9: Know
277.1: about
277.3: it?

277.9: It
278.1: was
278.3: a
278.5: kill
278.7: squad.
278.9: Black-on-black.

280.0: We
280.3: closed
280.6: it
280.8: down
280.9: two
281.2: years
281.3: ago.

281.6: Nobody
282.5: wants
282.7: to
282.8: know
282.9: about
283.1: Treadstone.

283.3: Not
283.8: around
284.1: here.

284.2: So
284.7: I
284.8: think
284.9: you
285.1: better
285.2: take
285.4: this
285.6: back
285.8: to
285.9: Marty

286.2: and
286.4: let
286.7: him
286.8: know
286.9: exactly
287.7: what
287.9: you
287.9: are
288.0: doing.

288.6: He
288.6: does.
289.3: I
289.3: have
289.6: been
289.8: down
290.0: to
290.1: the
290.1: archives.

290.8: I
291.1: have
291.3: the
291.5: files,
291.8: Ward.

294.7: Let's
295.3: talk
295.5: about
295.7: Conklin.

296.2: What
296.4: are
296.6: you
296.8: after,
297.0: Pam?

297.6: You
297.8: wanna
298.0: fry
298.3: me?

299.5: You
300.0: want
300.1: my
300.3: desk.
300.5: Is
300.7: that
300.9: it?

300.8: I
301.0: wanna
301.2: know
301.4: what
301.6: happened.
301.8: What
302.0: happened?

302.8: Jason
303.4: Bourne
303.7: happened.
304.0: You
304.1: got
304.2: the
304.3: files.

306.2: Then
306.6: let's
306.8: cut
306.9: the
307.1: crap.

308.3: Conklin
308.7: had
309.1: these
309.2: guys
309.3: wound
309.5: so
309.7: tight,
309.9: they
310.1: were
310.3: Bound
310.5: to
310.7: snap.

312.1: Bourne
312.3: was
312.6: his
312.9: number
313.2: one.

313.9: The
314.3: guy
314.4: went
314.6: for
314.8: a
314.8: job,
315.1: screwed
315.4: the
315.7: op,
316.0: never
316.3: came
316.5: Back.

317.1: Conklin
317.3: could
317.5: not
317.7: fix
317.9: it,
318.1: could
318.3: not
318.5: find
318.7: Bourne,
318.9: could
319.1: not
319.3: adjust.

319.6: It
319.8: all
320.1: went
320.5: sideways.

321.2: So
321.2: you
321.2: had
321.3: Conklin
322.2: killed?

323.9: I
323.9: mean,
323.9: if
323.9: we
323.9: are
324.0: cutting
325.0: the
325.0: crap.

325.6: I
325.8: have
326.0: given
326.2: 30
326.4: years
326.6: and
326.8: two
326.9: marriages
327.1: to
327.3: this
327.5: agency.

328.0: I
328.2: have
328.4: shoveled
328.6: shit
328.8: on
329.0: four
329.2: continents.

330.0: I
330.0: am
330.2: due
330.4: to
330.4: retire
330.5: next
330.7: year.

331.2: But
331.4: if
331.6: you
331.8: think
332.0: I
332.2: am
332.4: gonna
332.6: sit
332.8: here

332.6: and
332.8: let
333.0: you
333.2: dangle
333.4: me
333.6: with
333.8: this,

334.3: you
334.7: can
334.9: go
335.0: to
335.1: hell.
335.3: And
336.5: Marshall,
336.7: too.

338.7: It
339.1: had
339.3: to
339.4: be
339.6: done.

341.3: And
341.5: Bourne?
342.3: Where
342.4: is
342.5: he
342.7: now?

342.8: Dead
342.8: in
342.8: a
342.8: ditch.
342.8: Drunk
343.3: in
343.8: a
344.4: Bar
344.5: in
344.6: Mogadishu.

345.0: Who
345.2: knows.
345.4: I
345.6: think
345.8: I
346.0: do.

347.1: I
347.4: had
347.6: a
347.6: deal
347.8: going
347.9: down
348.1: in
348.4: Berlin
348.7: last
348.9: week.

349.3: And
349.6: during
349.8: the
350.0: Buy,
350.2: Both
350.4: our
350.6: case
351.0: officer
351.1: and
351.3: the
351.5: seller
351.7: were
351.9: killed.

353.1: They
353.5: were
353.6: killed
353.9: by
354.0: Jason
354.3: Bourne.

359.0: They
359.0: are
359.4: ready
359.5: for
359.7: us
359.9: upstairs.

400.2: Seven
400.7: years
400.9: ago,
401.2: $20
401.6: million
402.2: of
402.3: CIA
402.7: funds
402.9: disappeared

403.7: during
404.0: a
404.3: wire
404.6: transfer
405.1: through
405.3: Moscow.

406.2: In
406.2: the
406.3: investigation
407.4: that
407.5: followed

408.2: we
408.4: were
408.6: contacted
408.8: by
409.0: a
409.2: Russian
409.4: politician,
409.6: Vladimir
409.8: Neski.

411.7: Neski
412.4: claimed
412.6: we
412.9: had
413.0: a
413.1: leak
413.2: and
414.0: that
414.1: we
414.2: would
414.3: been
414.4: ripped
414.7: off
414.8: by
414.9: one
415.1: of
415.3: our
415.5: own.

415.7: And
416.0: were
416.4: we?

416.9: We
417.3: never
417.4: found
417.7: out.

417.8: We
418.1: were
418.4: negotiating
418.7: a
419.1: meet
419.3: with
419.3: Mr.
419.6: Neski
419.7: when
420.0: he
420.1: was
420.2: killed.

420.4: By
420.4: who?
420.4: His
421.5: wife.

422.0: The
422.4: case
422.6: had
422.8: gone
423.0: cold
423.4: until
423.5: a
423.7: month
423.8: ago
423.9: when
424.2: we
424.3: found
424.4: a
424.6: source.

424.8: Another
425.5: Russian
425.8: in
426.1: Berlin
426.5: who
426.6: claimed

426.8: to
427.0: have
427.1: access
427.3: to
427.6: the
427.7: Neski
427.8: murder
428.4: files.

429.0: We
429.4: thought
429.5: we
429.7: had
429.9: another
430.1: bite
430.4: at
430.5: the
430.6: apple.

434.3: Turns
434.6: out
434.9: the
435.3: assassin
435.6: was
435.9: one
436.3: of
436.6: our
436.9: own,
437.3: Jason
437.9: Bourne.

439.3: Now
439.4: I
439.9: know
440.1: Treadstone
440.1: is
440.4: not
441.1: a
441.2: very
441.4: popular
441.6: subject
441.8: around
442.0: here,

442.4: but
442.7: we
443.0: found
443.1: some
443.4: interesting
443.6: things
444.1: when
444.3: we
444.6: dug
444.8: a
444.9: little
444.9: deeper.

445.5: This
445.9: is
446.0: Conklin's
446.1: personal
447.3: computer.

448.3: His
448.8: Treadstone
449.2: files
449.7: are
449.8: bloated
450.2: with
450.6: code
450.9: keys
451.1: and
451.4: case
451.6: files

451.9: that
452.1: he
452.3: neither
452.5: needed
452.7: nor
452.9: had
453.1: clearance
453.3: for.

454.3: Buried
454.8: in
454.9: the
455.0: hard
455.2: drive,
455.6: we
455.7: found
456.0: a
456.1: deleted
456.3: file

456.8: with
456.9: an
457.0: account
457.3: number
457.4: to
457.7: a
457.7: bank
458.0: in
458.1: Zurich.

458.6: At
458.9: the
459.0: time
459.2: of
459.3: his
459.5: death,

459.6: he
459.8: was
460.2: sitting
460.3: on
460.5: a
460.6: personal
461.0: account
461.5: in
461.6: the
461.7: amount
461.9: of
462.0: $760,000.

463.4: You
463.9: know
464.0: what
464.2: his
464.3: budget
464.4: was?

465.4: We
465.8: were
465.8: throwing
466.2: money
466.5: at
466.7: him.

466.6: Throwing
466.8: it
467.0: at
467.2: him
467.5: and
467.6: asking
467.8: him
468.0: to
468.1: keep
468.3: it
468.5: dark.

468.6: It
468.8: was
469.0: his
469.1: own
469.2: account.
469.6: He
469.8: was
470.1: up
470.3: to
470.5: something.

470.4: This
470.6: is
470.8: supposed
471.0: to
471.2: be
471.4: definitive?

471.8: What
471.9: is
472.1: definitive
472.4: is
472.7: that
472.8: I
473.0: just
473.2: lost
473.4: two
473.6: people
473.8: in
474.0: Berlin.

474.3: So
474.4: what
474.6: is
474.8: your
475.0: theory?
475.2: Conklin
475.2: is
475.2: reaching
475.9: out
476.0: from
476.1: the
476.2: grave

476.4: to
476.5: protect
476.8: his
476.9: good
477.1: name?
477.4: The
477.9: man
478.4: is
478.7: dead.

479.1: No
479.3: one
479.3: is
479.5: disputing
479.7: that,
479.9: Ward.

480.0: For
480.2: Christ's
481.0: sake,
481.2: Marty,
481.4: you
481.6: knew
481.8: Conklin.

483.0: Does
