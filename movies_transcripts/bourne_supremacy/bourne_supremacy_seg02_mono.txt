197.6: How

207.9: anybody.

209.1: This

349.2: only
349.4: way
349.6: he
349.8: can

355.2: not
355.4: want
355.6: you
355.8: to
356.0: do
356.2: it.

355.8: I
355.8: told
355.9: them
356.0: what
356.1: would
356.2: happen
356.3: if
356.4: they
356.5: did
356.6: not
356.7: leave
356.8: us
357.1: alone.

357.9: It

358.3: never
358.5: gonna
358.7: be
358.9: over
359.1: like

361.0: not
361.2: have
361.4: a
361.6: choice.

362.2: Yes,

506.4: lines,
506.6: and
506.8: one

508.3: the
508.5: one
508.7: that
509.0: did

509.8: the
510.0: Germans
510.2: can
510.4: not
510.6: match
510.8: it?

511.2: No.
511.4: Nobody
511.4: has
511.6: got
511.8: it.

512.4: We
512.6: checked
512.9: out
513.0: every
513.3: database
513.5: we
513.8: could
513.9: access.
