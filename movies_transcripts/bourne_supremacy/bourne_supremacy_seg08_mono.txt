97.4: They
97.6: missed
97.9: him?
98.2: Yeah,
98.5: so
98.7: far.

99.1: But
99.3: they
99.5: found
99.7: Nicky.
99.9: She
100.1: is
100.3: back
100.5: at
100.7: the
100.9: Westin.

100.9: Bourne
101.1: let
101.3: her
101.6: go.

101.9: He
102.1: let
102.3: her
102.5: go?
102.7: Yeah.

105.0: Where
105.0: is
105.2: Danny
105.4: Zorn?

106.5: He
106.7: ought
107.0: to
107.0: head
107.2: over
107.3: there
107.6: and
107.8: debrief
108.0: her.

109.7: Why
110.1: did
110.4: Bourne
110.7: come
111.0: here?

111.3: We
111.7: do
111.7: not
111.9: know
112.0: yet.

113.0: Landy
113.0: is
113.6: upstairs
114.0: in
114.1: one
114.2: of
114.2: the
114.3: rooms.

114.7: She
115.2: said
115.3: she
115.4: would
115.5: call
115.6: you
115.8: when
115.9: she
116.0: is
116.1: done.

119.4: Okay.

122.8: I
123.4: think
124.0: I
124.6: will
125.2: take
125.6: a
125.7: cab
126.1: back
126.2: to
126.3: the
126.5: hotel.

133.1: So
133.3: the
133.5: room
133.7: he
133.9: checked
134.2: into
134.4: was
134.6: across
134.7: the
134.9: hall.

137.4: Why
137.6: would
137.8: he
138.0: come
138.1: in
138.2: here?

147.8: What
148.0: are
148.2: you
148.4: thinking?

149.0: I
149.2: recognize
149.4: this
149.6: room
149.8: from
150.0: a
150.2: photo.

152.5: There
152.8: was
152.9: a
153.0: chalk
153.3: outline
153.6: right
153.7: here

154.2: around
154.6: the
154.7: body
154.9: of
155.1: Vladimir
155.3: Neski.

157.5: This
157.7: is
157.9: where
158.1: his
158.3: wife
158.5: killed
158.7: him?

160.9: Do
161.1: you
161.3: still
161.5: think
161.7: his
161.9: wife
162.1: killed
162.3: him?

172.1: Guess
172.2: he
172.3: got
172.4: out
172.6: through
172.9: this
172.9: window.

175.5: We
175.9: just
176.0: got
176.2: word
176.4: from
176.6: the
176.7: Berlin
177.0: police.

178.5: They
178.9: found
179.1: Danny
179.3: Zorn's
179.6: body.

185.3: I
185.6: want
185.8: you
185.8: two
185.9: to
186.1: stay
186.5: on
186.7: Bourne.

187.2: Check
187.7: everything
187.8: that
188.0: is
188.3: out
188.4: there.

189.7: Call
190.0: Abbott.
190.3: Tell
190.4: him
190.5: to
190.6: wait
190.7: for
190.8: me
190.9: in
191.0: his
191.1: hotel.

192.3: I
192.5: am
192.7: coming
192.9: to
193.1: see
193.3: him.

223.0: Da.
223.4: It
223.9: is
224.4: me.

226.2: They
226.4: are
226.6: onto
226.8: Neski.

229.1: This
229.1: is
229.1: not
229.1: a
229.2: clean
230.1: phone.

230.5: They
230.8: can
230.8: not
231.1: prove
231.2: anything
231.4: without
231.6: Bourne.

232.6: Kill
233.0: Bourne,
233.4: and
233.6: you
233.7: kill
233.9: this
234.0: investigation.

235.3: I
235.3: am
235.7: afraid,
236.0: Ward,
236.3: the
237.4: time
237.7: has
237.8: come
237.9: for
238.2: us
238.3: to
238.6: part
238.8: company.

239.4: Listen,
239.4: Yuri,
239.4: you
239.4: bought
239.4: those
239.4: oil
239.4: leases
241.1: with
241.3: $20
241.5: million
241.7: in
241.9: stolen
242.4: CIA
242.7: seed
243.1: money.

244.2: You
244.6: owe
244.7: me.

245.0: I
245.3: gave
245.6: you
245.8: your
246.0: cut.

246.5: We
246.5: both
246.7: got
246.9: rich.

248.6: I
248.9: do
248.9: not
249.5: owe
249.7: you
249.9: anything.

250.6: The
251.0: plan
251.4: can
251.6: still
251.8: be
251.9: salvaged.
252.3: Just
252.8: get
253.0: Bourne.
253.2: Do
253.4: you
253.6: hear
253.8: me?

254.7: He
254.8: is
254.9: still
255.2: out
255.4: there.
255.5: Now
256.0: get
256.2: him.

256.4: Get
256.6: Jason...

278.8: I
279.0: do
279.2: not
279.4: suppose
279.6: it
279.6: will
279.7: do
279.8: me
280.0: much
280.2: good
280.3: to
280.5: cry
280.7: for
280.9: help,
281.1: huh?

283.2: Not
283.6: much.

287.1: You
287.5: killed
287.8: her.

289.3: It
289.7: was
289.8: a
289.9: mistake.

291.2: It
291.6: was
291.7: supposed
291.9: to
292.0: be
292.1: you.

294.1: There
294.3: were
294.5: files
294.7: linking
294.9: me
295.1: to
295.3: the
295.5: Neski
295.7: murder.

298.1: If
298.3: the
298.5: files
298.7: disappeared
298.9: and
299.1: they
299.3: suspected
299.5: you,

301.5: they
301.6: would
301.7: be
301.9: chasing
302.3: a
302.4: ghost
302.6: for
302.9: 10
303.1: years.

304.0: So
304.4: we
304.5: got
304.6: in
304.8: the
304.9: way.

306.0: Is
306.4: that
306.5: why
306.7: Neski
306.8: died?

308.1: Is
308.2: that
308.6: why
308.8: you
308.8: killed
309.1: Marie?

309.6: You
309.9: killed
310.3: Marie,

311.8: the
312.2: minute
312.4: you
312.5: climbed
312.7: into
312.8: her
313.0: car.

314.1: The
314.4: minute
314.6: you
314.7: entered
314.9: her
315.1: life,
315.3: she
315.5: was
315.6: dead.

317.4: I
317.6: told
317.8: you
318.1: people
318.3: to
318.5: leave
318.7: us
318.9: alone.
319.2: I
319.7: fell
320.0: off
320.1: the
320.3: grid.

320.4: I
320.5: was
320.6: halfway
321.0: around
321.2: the
321.4: world.

321.8: There
321.8: is
322.3: no
322.4: place
322.6: it
322.9: will
322.9: not
323.1: catch
323.4: up
323.5: to
323.7: you.

325.1: It
325.3: is
325.5: how
325.7: every
325.9: story
326.1: ends.

327.6: It
327.8: is
328.0: what
328.2: you
328.4: are,
328.6: Jason,
328.8: a
329.0: killer.

331.5: You
331.9: always
332.3: will
332.5: be.

335.3: Go
335.6: ahead.
335.8: Go
336.0: on.
336.2: Go
336.4: on!
336.6: Do
336.8: it!
337.0: Do
337.2: it!

341.0: She
341.4: would
341.4: not
341.5: want
341.7: me
341.9: to.

342.8: That
343.1: is
343.5: the
343.6: only
343.8: reason
344.0: you
344.0: are
344.2: alive.

421.1: I
421.5: am
422.0: a
422.4: patriot.
422.9: I
423.3: serve
423.8: my
423.9: country.

425.5: And
425.7: Danny
425.9: Zorn?
426.1: What
426.3: was
426.5: he?

427.0: Unlucky.

429.9: Collateral
430.5: damage.

434.7: So
435.2: what
435.3: do
435.4: we
435.5: do
435.6: now?

437.5: I
437.5: am
437.7: not
438.0: sorry.

499.3: No,
499.5: no,
499.7: no,
499.9: forget
500.1: it.

500.9: Call
501.1: me
501.3: as
501.5: soon
501.7: as
501.9: he
502.1: is
502.3: here.

502.5: No,
502.7: that
502.7: is
502.9: nothing.

503.8: We
504.0: could
504.2: synch-up.

505.0: Who
505.2: is
505.4: this
505.6: guy?

506.1: Platform
506.3: P.

508.6: Go
508.8: ahead.
509.0: Go
509.2: on.
509.4: Go
509.6: on!
509.8: Do
510.0: it!
510.2: Do
510.4: it!

512.6: She
512.8: would
513.0: not
513.2: want
513.4: me
513.6: to.

514.3: That
514.3: is
514.8: the
514.8: only
515.0: reason
515.2: you
515.2: are
515.4: alive.

528.9: Got
529.3: a
529.4: call
529.5: from
529.6: Langley.

530.8: They
530.8: are
531.6: going
532.3: through
532.5: Abbott's
532.7: records

533.4: and
533.6: Marshall
533.8: wants
534.0: to
534.2: know
534.4: what
534.6: is
534.8: going
535.0: on
535.2: with
535.4: Bourne.

539.2: Wait,
539.6: Teddy.
540.0: Teddy,
540.4: who
540.8: is
540.9: this?
541.0: Look
541.1: at
541.2: this
541.4: guy.

541.9: He
541.9: is
541.9: about
541.9: to
541.9: enter.
541.9: Right
542.1: there!
542.3: There!

543.6: Right

546.0: Get
546.2: down
546.4: here!
546.7: We
546.9: got
547.2: something!
547.4: We
547.6: got
547.8: him!

548.0: We
548.1: got
548.3: a
548.6: sighting!
548.9: Check
549.1: it
549.3: out!

549.7: There.
549.8: I
549.9: got
550.0: it
550.1: on
550.3: the
550.4: big
550.5: monitor.
550.7: Hold

552.3: There
552.5: he
552.7: comes
552.9: again.

554.6: Whoa,
554.9: whoa.
555.2: Hold
555.5: on.
555.6: He
555.7: is
555.8: just
555.9: entered
556.1: frame.

556.6: It
556.7: is

561.2: That
561.2: is
561.3: the
561.4: train
561.5: to
561.6: Moscow.

562.8: Why
562.8: the
563.0: hell
563.0: would
563.1: he
563.2: go
563.3: to
563.4: Moscow?

567.4: Get
