46.4: All
46.8: right,
47.0: I
47.2: finished
47.4: my
47.6: box
47.8: work

48.8: but
48.8: I
48.8: wanted
49.3: to
49.4: show
49.4: you
49.7: before
49.9: I
50.2: showed
50.4: Landy.

51.1: I
51.3: came
51.5: down
51.7: here
51.9: last
52.1: night
52.3: because
52.5: none
52.7: of
52.9: this
53.1: is
53.3: making
53.5: any
53.7: sense.

54.5: I
54.7: mean,
54.9: I
55.1: am
55.3: with
55.5: you.
55.7: Conklin
55.9: was
56.1: a
56.3: nut.
56.5: But
56.7: a
56.9: traitor?

57.1: I
57.5: just
57.7: can
57.7: not
57.9: get
58.0: there.

58.8: What
59.2: do
59.3: you
59.3: have,
59.5: Danny?

60.3: All
60.5: right,
60.7: you
60.9: put
61.1: a
61.3: four-gram
61.5: Kel
61.7: on
61.9: here,
62.1: it
62.3: is
62.5: gonna
62.7: take
62.9: out
63.1: power
63.3: to
63.5: the
63.7: building.

64.0: You
64.2: know
64.4: that.

65.2: There
65.2: were
65.3: two
66.0: charges
66.5: that
66.6: were
66.7: supposed
66.9: to
67.0: go
67.1: off
67.2: simultaneously.

68.1: The
68.1: second
68.7: one,

69.2: the
69.4: one
69.6: over
69.8: here,
70.0: did
70.2: not
70.4: go
70.6: off.

71.6: Now,
71.8: first
72.0: of
72.2: all,
72.4: this
72.6: is
72.8: nothing.

73.5: It
73.6: is
73.8: a
74.0: sub-line
74.2: for
74.4: the
74.5: breaker
74.7: above.

75.3: And
75.5: second,
75.7: why
75.9: put
76.1: the
76.3: charge
76.5: all
76.7: the
76.9: way
77.1: down
77.3: here?

78.1: If
78.2: you
78.3: are
78.5: good
78.9: enough
79.1: to
79.2: get
79.4: in
79.6: here
79.7: and
79.9: handle
80.2: the
80.4: gear,

80.5: you
80.7: are
80.9: good
81.1: enough
81.3: to
81.5: know
81.7: you
81.9: do
82.1: not
82.3: need
82.5: this.

82.6: Bourne
82.8: would
83.0: know.

84.5: It
84.7: was
84.9: staged?

86.0: Is
86.2: it
86.4: a
86.6: slam-dunk?
86.8: No.

87.5: But
87.7: what
87.9: if
88.1: somebody
88.3: were
88.5: trying
88.7: to
88.9: cover
89.1: their
89.3: tracks

89.8: by
90.2: blaming
90.7: Conklin
90.9: and
91.1: Bourne?

92.3: What
92.4: if
92.5: Bourne
92.7: did
92.8: not
93.0: have
93.2: anything
93.5: to
93.7: do
93.8: with
93.9: this?

97.6: Show
97.9: me
98.0: again.

98.8: All
99.0: right.

99.9: Well,
100.1: you
100.3: put...

126.9: Pull
127.3: over.
127.3: He
127.4: is
127.7: getting
128.0: out.

131.9: This
132.0: is
132.1: not
132.2: a
132.4: drill,
132.8: soldier.

134.1: We
134.3: clear
134.5: on
134.7: that?

136.6: This
136.8: is
137.0: a
137.2: live
137.5: project,
137.7: and
137.9: you
138.1: are
138.3: a
138.5: go.

142.1: I
142.1: will
142.5: see
142.7: you
142.8: on
142.9: the
143.0: other
143.1: side.

164.2: Good
164.7: evening,
164.9: sir.

166.7: want
167.0: to

167.7: night.

168.1: Do
168.1: you
168.1: have

177.4: available?

179.3: before.

184.1: I

188.4: the
188.5: hall.

190.2: Sir?

474.1: the
474.3: hell
474.3: is
474.5: he
474.7: doing
474.9: here?

475.4: Maybe
475.5: he
475.6: just
475.7: wanted
475.8: to
475.9: stay
476.3: the
476.4: night.
